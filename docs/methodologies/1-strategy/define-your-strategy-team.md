# Define your Microsoft Fabric strategy team

Your Fabric strategy team plays a crucial role in aligning business and technical objectives, driving value realization, and ensuring secure, sustainable adoption of Microsoft Fabric services. This team defines the motivations, business outcomes, and operating models that guide the overall adoption journey.

## Why do you need a Fabric strategy team?

Establishing a Fabric strategy team helps your organization:

- **Align business and data priorities** with Fabricâ€™s capabilities
- **Ensure adoption is goal-driven**, measurable, and tied to value
- **Accelerate transformation** with a unified roadmap and ownership
- **Reduce risk** by proactively addressing security, governance, and compliance
- **Foster innovation and agility** by connecting domain needs to platform features

## Recommended roles and functions

Start small with a core group and expand the team iteratively. Recommended functions include:

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **Central IT** | Oversees operational efficiency, Fabric infrastructure, OneLake capacity, and workspace policies |
| **Business decision makers (BDMs)** | Define business priorities and ensure data product investment aligns with revenue, risk, and innovation |
| **IT decision makers (ITDMs)** | Connect Fabric services with enterprise architecture and guide feasibility and integration |
| **Lead data/solution architects** | Translate business strategy into scalable Fabric components like Lakehouse, Warehouse, and Semantic Models |
| **Fabric security & governance team** | Apply Entra ID, Purview, and DLP frameworks; enforce secure-by-default posture |
| **Compliance & legal** | Ensure regulatory requirements are embedded in workspace and data policies |
| **Finance (FinOps)** | Monitor Fabric consumption, budget control, cost allocation across domains and teams |
| **Executive sponsor** | Drives organizational alignment, supports funding, and anchors the strategic intent |

## Seek cross-functional input

In addition to core roles, involve extended stakeholders for broader impact:

- **Finance leadership**: Guides budgeting, chargebacks, and return on investment evaluations
- **Marketing**: Ensures data and analytics contribute to customer experience and branding
- **Sales**: Aligns domain data products with pipeline and account intelligence
- **Human Resources (HR)**: Supports upskilling, change management, and product thinking transformation
- **Sustainability & ESG leads**: Map Fabric optimization and data usage to environmental KPIs

## Recommendations for success

- **Start lean, expand smart**: Begin with IT, data, security, and finance. Expand to domains and compliance as strategy matures.
- **Assign clear responsibilities**: Document decision rights, communication paths, and escalation protocols.
- **Review membership regularly**: Evaluate representation and effectiveness every quarter.
- **Create a living charter**: Include mission, principles, and operating rhythm (cadence, milestones).
- **Iterate the strategy**: Use early adoption cases to inform and grow team engagement and structure.
