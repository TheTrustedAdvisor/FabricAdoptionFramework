# Define your Microsoft Fabric strategy team

Your Fabric strategy team plays a crucial role in aligning business and technical objectives, driving value realization, and ensuring secure, sustainable adoption of Microsoft Fabric services. Beyond defining motivations, business outcomes, and operating models, this team serves as the strategic and operational backbone for governance, innovation enablement, and continuous business value delivery. By orchestrating cross-functional collaboration, enforcing compliance, and fostering an agile culture, the Fabric strategy team ensures that Microsoft Fabric not only supports but accelerates your organization's data-driven transformation.

## Why do you need a Fabric strategy team?

Establishing a Fabric strategy team helps your organization:

- **Align business and data priorities with Fabricâ€™s capabilities:** For example, aligning sales and operations teams around unified metrics within Fabric ensures consistent performance measurement and drives coordinated decision-making.
- **Ensure adoption is goal-driven, measurable, and tied to value:** Embedding clear KPIs and tracking mechanisms helps quantify impact, such as reducing time-to-insight or increasing data product utilization.
- **Accelerate transformation with a unified roadmap and ownership:** Defining clear domain onboarding processes and ownership accelerates adoption by reducing friction and clarifying responsibilities.
- **Reduce risk by proactively addressing security, governance, and compliance:** Embedding security practices early in the development lifecycle, such as enforcing data classification and access controls, mitigates potential breaches and compliance gaps.
- **Foster innovation and agility by connecting domain needs to platform features:** Enabling rapid prototyping and feedback loops empowers teams to experiment with Fabric capabilities and iterate on data products.

## Recommended roles and functions

Start small with a core group and expand the team iteratively. Recommended functions include:

| Function | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| **Central IT** | Oversees operational efficiency, Fabric infrastructure, OneLake capacity, and workspace policies. Typical deliverables include infrastructure health reports, capacity planning documents, and SLA adherence metrics. KPIs may track system uptime and resource utilization. |
| **Business decision makers (BDMs)** | Define business priorities and ensure data product investment aligns with revenue, risk, and innovation goals. Deliverables include business case documents, prioritization frameworks, and ROI analyses. KPIs track business impact such as revenue growth or risk reduction. |
| **IT decision makers (ITDMs)** | Connect Fabric services with enterprise architecture and guide feasibility and integration. Responsibilities include architectural standards, integration blueprints, and technology roadmaps. KPIs focus on integration success rates and system interoperability. |
| **Lead data/solution architects** | Translate business strategy into scalable Fabric components like Lakehouse, Warehouse, and Semantic Models. Deliverables include solution designs, data model standards, and deployment guides. KPIs may include data quality scores and solution adoption rates. |
| **Fabric security & governance team** | Apply Entra ID, Purview, and DLP frameworks; enforce secure-by-default posture. Deliverables include security policies, compliance audits, and incident response plans. KPIs track compliance adherence and security incident reduction. |
| **Compliance & legal** | Ensure regulatory requirements are embedded in workspace and data policies. Responsibilities include legal reviews, policy enforcement, and audit readiness. KPIs monitor regulatory compliance status and audit findings. |
| **Finance (FinOps)** | Monitor Fabric consumption, budget control, cost allocation across domains and teams. Deliverables include cost reports, chargeback models, and budget forecasts. KPIs focus on cost efficiency and budget variance. |
| **Executive sponsor** | Drives organizational alignment, supports funding, and anchors the strategic intent. Responsibilities include executive communications, stakeholder engagement, and strategic decision-making. KPIs measure overall program health and stakeholder satisfaction. |
| **Change Management Lead** | Drives organizational adoption, training, and communications. Deliverables include training plans, communication campaigns, and adoption metrics. KPIs track user engagement, training completion rates, and change adoption speed. |
| **Data Product Owners** | Ensure domain-specific data products meet business and quality requirements. Responsibilities include backlog management, quality assurance, and stakeholder liaison. KPIs include data product usage, quality scores, and time-to-market. |

## Seek cross-functional input

In addition to core roles, involve extended stakeholders for broader impact:

- **Finance leadership:** Guides budgeting, chargebacks, and return on investment evaluations.
- **Marketing:** Ensures data and analytics contribute to customer experience and branding.
- **Sales:** Aligns domain data products with pipeline and account intelligence.
- **Human Resources (HR):** Supports upskilling, change management, and product thinking transformation.
- **Sustainability & ESG leads:** Map Fabric optimization and data usage to environmental KPIs.
- **Customer Support:** Provides insights on customer issues and feedback to improve data products and services.
- **Product Management:** Aligns Fabric capabilities with product roadmaps and customer requirements to maximize value delivery.

## Recommendations for success

- **Start lean, expand smart:** Begin with IT, data, security, and finance. Expand to domains and compliance as strategy matures.
- **Assign clear responsibilities:** Document decision rights, communication paths, and escalation protocols. Establish a RACI matrix to clarify roles and accountability.
- **Review membership regularly:** Evaluate representation and effectiveness every quarter through strategic reviews.
- **Create a living charter:** Include mission, principles, and operating rhythm (cadence, milestones).
- **Iterate the strategy:** Use early adoption cases to inform and grow team engagement and structure.
- **Maintain a shared backlog:** Keep a prioritized list of platform initiatives and enhancements to ensure continuous improvement and transparency.
