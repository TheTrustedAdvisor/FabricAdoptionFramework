# Define your mission and objectives for Fabric adoption

A successful Microsoft Fabric adoption needs a clear **mission** and well‑defined **objectives**. The mission sets purpose and direction; the objectives and key results (OKRs) explain how you’ll achieve that mission and how progress will be measured. This guide upgrades your original text with practical templates, examples, and a measurement plan you can implement immediately.

> **Who should use this?**
> Executive sponsors, platform owners, data/BI leaders, governance & security, and domain product owners.

## Purpose (why define this now?)

Defining your mission and objectives ensures:

* **Alignment** between business outcomes and Fabric capabilities (OneLake, Lakehouse, Warehouse, Real‑Time, BI).
* **Clarity** in the adoption roadmap and scope boundaries.
* **Prioritization** of high‑impact initiatives and sequence of work.
* **Measurability** with transparent KPIs and target dates for accountability.

Frameworks like **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** help structure goals and maintain alignment across teams.

---

## Mission statement (what good looks like)

A concise Fabric mission statement should answer:

* **Why**: Strategic motivation (value, risk, speed, experience).
* **What**: Outcomes Fabric must enable (e.g., trusted data products, governed self‑service, real‑time activation).
* **How**: Guardrails and measures of success at a high level.
* **Scope & horizon**: Domains/regions in scope and the time frame (e.g., 12–18 months).
* **Non‑goals**: Explicitly state what you will not do now (helps focus).

### Mission template

> \*“Within \*\*, we will adopt ****Microsoft Fabric**** to \*\*, empowering ****\<target groups/domains>**** to deliver \**. We will operate within **************\<governance/security principles>************** and measure success via **************\<top‑level KPIs>**************.”*

### Example mission statements

* **Regulated enterprise**: *“Over the next 12 months, adopt Microsoft Fabric to unify analytics on OneLake, reduce regulatory risk through standardized governance, and accelerate insights for Finance and Customer domains. Success is measured by certified semantic models, policy compliance, and a 30% reduction in report lead time.”*
* **Digital‑first scale‑up**: *“In two quarters, enable product teams to ship data products weekly on Fabric with automated testing and CI/CD, while maintaining cost efficiency within ±5% of budget and reusing shared semantic models.”*
* **Public sector**: *“In 18 months, provide auditable, privacy‑preserving analytics on Fabric to improve service outcomes and transparency, with >90% catalog coverage and published data quality scorecards.”*
* **Manufacturing**: *“Adopt Fabric to connect plant telemetry with supply chain analytics, enabling near‑real‑time decisions and a 20% reduction in downtime, with secure domain autonomy under centralized guardrails.”*

---

## Writing effective OKRs (how to frame)

* **Few and focused**: 3–5 objectives per level, 3–4 key results per objective.
* **Outcome‑oriented**: Key results are effects (e.g., time‑to‑insight ↓), not tasks.
* **Baseline → target → date**: Always include the current baseline and a target with due date.
* **Lead vs. lag**: Balance adoption “leads” (e.g., CI/CD coverage) with business “lags” (e.g., revenue impact).
* **Ownership**: Each KR has a single accountable owner.

> **Scoring**: Use 0.0–1.0 (or 0–100%). Stretch targets should land around 0.6–0.7 at quarter end if healthy.

> Customize baselines/targets to your context; ensure each KR is auditable.

## Alignment and cascade

Create a simple cascade so teams see how their work connects:

* **Company/Portfolio level**: Business outcomes (e.g., revenue, risk reduction).
* **Fabric Program level**: The objectives above (platform, governance, BI, FinOps).
* **Domain/Product level**: Domain‑specific OKRs (e.g., Sales, Ops, Finance) aligned to the program.

Provide a one‑page **OKR map** illustrating the link from company goals → program objectives → domain KRs.

---

## Measurement plan (how you’ll track)

* **Data sources**: Fabric tenant/workspace settings export, capacity/cost metrics, Power BI Admin/Usage metrics, catalog coverage & lineage, pipeline runs, incident system.
* **Cadence**: Monthly progress reviews, quarterly OKR scoring.
* **Dashboards**: Program scorecard (traffic lights), cost & capacity, security posture, delivery metrics (lead time, change failure rate), BI adoption.
* **Accountability**: Each KR owner updates metrics before review; platform owner consolidates.

---

## Recommendations

* Involve stakeholders from **data, IT, business, and compliance**.
* Run a **mission & OKR workshop** (see agenda below) to co‑create goals.
* Assign **single owners** per objective and KR; publish owners in your scorecard.
* Review progress **quarterly**; adjust scope and targets based on evidence.
* Synchronize with the **governance board** to handle exceptions and policy changes.

---

## Anti‑patterns to avoid

* Missions that are tool‑centric (e.g., “use Fabric”) vs. outcome‑centric.
* Key results that are tasks (e.g., “hold a meeting”) vs. measurable outcomes.
* Too many KRs; no baselines or dates.
* No single owner per KR; “shared” accountability.
* Measuring only adoption, not business value or reliability.

## Workshop: Mission & OKRs (90–120 minutes)

1. **Context & outcomes** (10’): Why now, decision criteria, constraints.
2. **Mission draft** (20’): Fill the template (Why/What/How/Scope/Non‑goals).
3. **Objectives brainstorm** (20’): Cluster into 3–5 objectives.
4. **Key results** (30’): Add baselines, targets, dates, and owners.
5. **Risks & assumptions** (10’): Capture blockers; define mitigations.
6. **Next steps** (10’): Confirm owners, dashboards, review cadence.

Artifacts: mission one‑pager, OKR map, initial scorecard, risk list.
