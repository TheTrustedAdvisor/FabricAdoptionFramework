# Define your mission and objectives for Fabric adoption

A successful Microsoft Fabric adoption requires a clear mission and well-defined objectives. Your mission provides strategic direction and purpose, while your objectives outline how you will achieve that mission in practice. Measurable goals help ensure accountability, continuous improvement, and business alignment.

## Purpose

Defining your mission and objectives ensures:

- Alignment between business goals and Fabric capabilities
- Clarity in the adoption roadmap
- Prioritization of high-impact initiatives
- Measurable outcomes to guide progress

Frameworks like **Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)** can be used to structure your goals and ensure alignment across teams.

## Mission statement

A Fabric adoption mission statement should address:

- **Why**: What is the strategic motivation behind Fabric?
- **What**: Which business outcomes should Fabric support?
- **How**: How will you measure success?

**Example mission statement**:  
_“Adopt Microsoft Fabric to unify our data platform, accelerate insights, empower domain teams, and deliver secure, scalable, and compliant data products aligned with business priorities.”_

## Recommendations

- Involve stakeholders from data, IT, business, and compliance teams.
- Use collaborative workshops to define shared goals.
- Align your Fabric objectives with the motivations previously defined.
- Assign owners to each objective and associated metrics.
- Review progress quarterly and iterate OKRs as needed.

## Measuring success

Set KPIs for each key result. Examples:

- % of Fabric workspaces using policies
- Avg. time from data acquisition to report delivery
- % of domains with compliant data sharing setup
- % automation in pipeline deployments

Continuous measurement ensures agility and transparency during Fabric adoption and scale-up.
