# Assess your Fabric adoption strategy

This article outlines a process you can use to evaluate your current Microsoft Fabric adoption strategy. The goal is to better understand your organization's maturity level, identify strategic gaps, and define improvement actions. Use this insight to align your data platform modernization with business priorities and enhance value realization.

Every adoption journey is different. Your strategy should reflect the unique goals, capabilities, and constraints of your organization. Microsoft Fabric provides a broad set of integrated services—such as Lakehouse, Data Warehouse, Real-Time Analytics, Power BI, and OneLake. Understanding which services to prioritize, and when, requires strategic reflection.

## Assessment process

To assess your current Fabric adoption posture, follow this process:

### 1. Evaluate your maturity

Use available frameworks and self-assessment tools (such as the Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator) to assess:

- Business alignment
- Technical readiness
- Governance and security posture
- Operational capabilities
- Organizational roles and support

### 2. Identify strategic gaps

After completing your assessment, document areas where current planning is incomplete or misaligned, such as:

- Missing governance model or ownership structures
- Lack of workspace architecture standards
- Incomplete metadata strategy or Purview integration
- Insufficient stakeholder involvement

### 3. Define action plans

Use the gap analysis to create action points that drive improvement. Examples include:

- Initiate a governance board
- Define workspace lifecycle policies
- Enable CI/CD pipelines for Fabric components
- Train product owners and domain leads

Communicate these priorities across business and IT leadership to drive coordinated execution.

### 4. Reassess and iterate

Your Fabric strategy should evolve as adoption deepens. Repeat this assessment regularly:

- Before major expansion (e.g., new domain onboarding)
- Post-launch reviews of data products
- Quarterly governance and cost review cycles

Continual refinement ensures your Fabric strategy remains aligned with your organization’s evolving goals and capabilities.
