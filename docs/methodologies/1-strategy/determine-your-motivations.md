# Determine your motivations for adopting Microsoft Fabric

This article helps you define and articulate the motivations behind adopting Microsoft Fabric. These motivations are critical for aligning business and IT strategy, justifying investments, and prioritizing adoption activities.

Clearly defined motivations support value realization, risk mitigation, and long-term governance success in the Fabric environment.

## Why define your motivations?

Understanding your motivations for adopting Microsoft Fabric enables:

- Strategic alignment across business, IT, and data governance
- Effective prioritization of domains, data products, and workloads
- Clarity in licensing, training, and operational decisions
- Realization of return on investment and platform capabilities

Fabric adoption can deliver value both directly (e.g., through lower infrastructure costs or simplified governance) and indirectly (e.g., by enabling faster insights and cross-domain collaboration).

## Example motivations for Fabric adoption

### Reduce business risk

- **Security**: Leverage Microsoft Entra ID, Purview, RLS/OLS, and encryption for strong data protection.
- **Compliance management**: Apply DLP policies, audit trails, and sensitivity labeling to reduce exposure.
- **Business continuity**: Use cloud-based recovery, replication, and global availability of OneLake.
- **Data governance**: Apply consistent metadata management and lineage tracking with Purview.
- **Infrastructure modernization**: Replace fragmented data tools with an integrated Fabric platform.

### Accelerate innovation

- **AI & Copilot integration**: Enable intelligent data interaction with built-in Copilot tools and ML services.
- **Real-time data insights**: Use Eventhouse and Real-Time Intelligence to support dynamic decision making.
- **Composable architecture**: Adopt modular services like Lakehouse and semantic models for agile product development.
- **Data democratization**: Empower domain teams with governed self-service and semantic layers in Power BI.
- **Innovation velocity**: Launch prototypes and analytics use cases rapidly without full infrastructure deployment.

### Enhance agility and efficiency

- **Operational efficiency**: Standardize tooling, workspaces, and pipelines across domains.
- **Multi-domain support**: Enable Data Mesh and cross-functional collaboration through OneLake sharing.
- **Simplified platform**: Integrate data movement, transformation, storage, and reporting in one unified platform.
- **Scalability**: Dynamically scale workloads (e.g., Lakehouse compute, Power BI Premium capacity).
- **Workspace management**: Govern resource allocation, lifecycle, and usage per domain.

## Classify and prioritize motivations

Once youâ€™ve identified relevant motivations, evaluate them based on business relevance and urgency:

| Motivation category           | Consideration                     | Priority | Urgency |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------|---------|
| Reduce business risk          | Data governance via Purview       | High     | High    |
| Reduce business risk          | Centralized access control        | High     | High    |
| Accelerate innovation         | AI & Copilot enablement           | High     | Medium  |
| Accelerate innovation         | Real-time analytics (Eventhouse)  | Medium   | Medium  |
| Enhance agility and efficiency| Workspace standardization         | High     | Medium  |
| Enhance agility and efficiency| Cross-domain collaboration        | Medium   | Low     |

Regularly review and update your motivations as business goals evolve. Link each major strategic or technical goal to a clearly stated motivation.
