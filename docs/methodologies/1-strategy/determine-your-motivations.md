## Why define your motivations?

Clarifying your motivations for adopting Microsoft Fabric enables you to:

- Align business, IT, and data governance strategies seamlessly
- Prioritize domains, data products, and workloads effectively
- Make informed decisions on licensing, training, and operations
- Maximize return on investment and leverage platform capabilities

Microsoft Fabric delivers value both directly—through cost savings and simplified governance—and indirectly—by accelerating insights and fostering collaboration across domains.

## Example motivations for Fabric adoption

### Reduce business risk

- **Security**: Utilize Microsoft Entra ID, Purview, RLS/OLS, and encryption to safeguard your data.
- **Compliance management**: Implement DLP policies, audit trails, and sensitivity labeling to minimize exposure.
- **Business continuity**: Benefit from cloud-based recovery, replication, and OneLake's global availability.
- **Data governance**: Maintain consistent metadata management and lineage tracking with Purview.
- **Infrastructure modernization**: Replace fragmented tools with a unified Fabric platform.

### Accelerate innovation

- **AI & Copilot integration**: Empower intelligent data interaction with built-in Copilot and machine learning services.
- **Real-time data insights**: Leverage Eventhouse and Real-Time Intelligence for dynamic decision-making.
- **Composable architecture**: Use modular services like Lakehouse and semantic models for agile development.
- **Data democratization**: Enable domain teams with governed self-service and semantic layers in Power BI.
- **Innovation velocity**: Rapidly launch prototypes and analytics use cases without full infrastructure deployment.

### Enhance agility and efficiency

- **Operational efficiency**: Standardize tools, workspaces, and pipelines across domains.
- **Multi-domain support**: Facilitate Data Mesh and cross-functional collaboration via OneLake sharing.
- **Simplified platform**: Consolidate data movement, transformation, storage, and reporting into one platform.
- **Scalability**: Dynamically scale workloads such as Lakehouse compute and Power BI Premium capacity.
- **Workspace management**: Govern resource allocation, lifecycle, and usage per domain.

## Classify and prioritize motivations

After identifying your key motivations, evaluate each based on its business relevance and urgency to focus your efforts where they matter most.

| Motivation category            | Consideration                     | Priority | Urgency |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|----------|---------|
| Reduce business risk           | Data governance via Purview     | High     | High    |
| Reduce business risk           | Centralized access control      | High     | High    |
| Accelerate innovation          | AI & Copilot enablement         | High     | Medium  |
| Accelerate innovation          | Real-time analytics (Eventhouse)| Medium   | Medium  |
| Enhance agility and efficiency | Workspace standardization       | High     | Medium  |
| Enhance agility and efficiency | Cross-domain collaboration      | Medium   | Low     |
