# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add initial .DS_Store file (4c00a75)

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This addition does not impact the content or functionality of the documentation itself.
- The inclusion of this file may be relevant for users who are navigating the directory on macOS systems.
- It is important to note that `.DS_Store` files are typically not necessary for version control and can be ignored in many cases.

Why it matters: Understanding the presence of system files like `.DS_Store` helps maintain a clean and relevant project structure.
