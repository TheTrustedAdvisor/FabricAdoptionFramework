# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add .DS_Store to strategy directory (4c00a75)

### Summary of Changes

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This file typically contains information about the layout and view options for the folder in Finder.
- The addition of this file does not affect the content or structure of the documentation.
- It is common for `.DS_Store` files to be included in repositories, but they can often be ignored in version control settings.

Why it matters: This change helps maintain the folder's view settings for users on macOS, ensuring a consistent experience when accessing the directory.
