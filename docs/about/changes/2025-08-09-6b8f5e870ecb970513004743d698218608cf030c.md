# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarify capacity overrun and MTTR targets (6b8f5e8)

### Summary of Changes

- Corrected wording in the document regarding capacity overrun metrics.
- Changed "less than 2%" from a numerical representation to a more descriptive phrase for clarity.
- Adjusted the target for "MTTR for P1 incidents" to also use the phrase "less than 2h" for consistency.
- Ensured that both metrics are now uniformly phrased to enhance readability.
- This change affects the "Define Your Mission and Objectives" section within the strategy methodology documentation.

Why it matters: This update improves the clarity and consistency of key performance indicators, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and track objectives.
