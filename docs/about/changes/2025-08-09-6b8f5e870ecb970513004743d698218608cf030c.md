# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Correct phrasing of capacity overrun targets (6b8f5e8)

### Summary of Changes

- Corrected the phrasing of target metrics in the document on defining mission and objectives.
- Changed "less than 2%" from a numerical representation to a more descriptive format for clarity.
- Updated the target for "capacity overrun" to specify "less than 2% monthly by Q4" instead of using the numeric symbol.
- Revised the target for "MTTR for P1 incidents" to also state "less than 2h by Q4" for consistency in language.
- Ensured that the language used in the document is clear and understandable for all users.
- The changes contribute to better comprehension of key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives.

Why it matters: These updates enhance clarity and ensure that performance targets are easily understood, facilitating better alignment and accountability within teams.
