- This action helps maintain a cleaner project structure by eliminating irrelevant files.
- The change simplifies the directory contents for contributors and users.
- It ensures that only relevant documentation files are included in version control.

Why it matters: This change improves repository cleanliness and usability by removing unnecessary system files.
