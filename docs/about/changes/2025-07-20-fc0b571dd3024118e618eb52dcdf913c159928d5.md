# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Remove unnecessary .DS_Store file (fc0b571)

## Release Notes Summary

- The file `.DS_Store` located in the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy` directory has been deleted.
- `.DS_Store` files are system files created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- Removing this file helps to keep the repository clean and free from unnecessary system files.
- The deletion does not affect any documentation or methodologies related to strategy.
- This change improves the overall organisation of the documentation directory.

Why it matters: Keeping the repository free from irrelevant files enhances clarity and maintainability.
