# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add .DS_Store to strategy directory (df993f0)

## Summary of Changes

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This file does not contain any relevant documentation or methodologies but is generated automatically by the operating system.
- The addition of this file does not affect the content or functionality of the documentation.
- It is recommended to exclude `.DS_Store` files from version control to keep the repository clean.

Why it matters: Keeping the repository free of unnecessary system files helps maintain clarity and organisation in the project.
