# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add initial .DS_Store file (df993f0)

## Summary of Changes

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder, such as icon positions and view options.
- This addition does not impact the content or methodologies documented in the directory.
- The presence of this file is typically not relevant for version control or documentation purposes.
- It is advisable to add `.DS_Store` to the `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being tracked in future commits.

Why it matters: Managing unnecessary system files in version control helps maintain a clean and relevant project history.
