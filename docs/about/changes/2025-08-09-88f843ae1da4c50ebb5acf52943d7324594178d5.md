# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarify budget overrun threshold wording (88f843a)

### Summary of Changes

- Corrected phrasing in the "Operations & FinOps" section to specify "less than 5% overrun" instead of "&lt;5% overrun".
- Updated the key results (KRs) in the OKRs section for clarity, replacing "&lt;2%" with "less than 2%" for consistency.
- Ensured consistent language throughout the document for better readability and understanding.

Why it matters: These changes enhance clarity and consistency in the documentation, making it easier for users to understand the expectations and metrics related to fabric adoption strategy.
