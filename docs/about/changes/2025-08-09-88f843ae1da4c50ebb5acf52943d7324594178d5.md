# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarify budget overrun percentage phrasing (88f843a)

## Summary of Changes

- Corrected phrasing in the "Operations & FinOps" section to specify "less than 5% overrun" instead of "&lt;5% overrun".
- Revised the key results (KRs) to maintain consistency in language, changing "less than" to a more explicit phrasing.
- Ensured clarity in the documentation for self-scoring each dimension, enhancing readability.
- Updated the table format to improve alignment and presentation of information.
- Maintained focus on operational efficiency and financial oversight in the context of fabric adoption strategy.
