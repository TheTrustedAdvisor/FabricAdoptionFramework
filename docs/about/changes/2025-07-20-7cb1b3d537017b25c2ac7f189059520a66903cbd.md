# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add .DS_Store to strategy directory (7cb1b3d)

### Summary of Changes

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This file is typically used to manage folder view options and icon positions on macOS.
- The addition of this file does not impact the functionality or content of the documentation.
- It is common for `.DS_Store` files to appear in repositories, particularly when files are created or modified on macOS systems.
- This change is part of an initial commit to establish the directory structure for the project.

Why it matters: The presence of `.DS_Store` files can clutter repositories, but they are often benign and related to user-specific settings.
