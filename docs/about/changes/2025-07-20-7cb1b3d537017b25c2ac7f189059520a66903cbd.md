# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add initial .DS_Store file (7cb1b3d)

## Summary of Changes

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This file does not contain any content relevant to the documentation or methodologies.
- Its inclusion may be necessary for maintaining folder settings or custom views on macOS systems.
- The addition does not impact the functionality or content of the existing documentation.
- It is common practice to ignore such files in version control systems to avoid clutter.

Why it matters: The presence of this file is primarily for local system preferences and does not affect the overall project or documentation quality.
