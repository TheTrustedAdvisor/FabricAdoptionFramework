# Changes â€“ 2025-06-03: Remove "What's New" Documentation Section (5a7d4f7)

- **[Impact: High]** The "What's New" documentation page has been removed, which previously highlighted monthly updates and changes in the Fabric Adoption Framework.

   [commit](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commit/5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea)  

Why it matters: The removal of this page may hinder users' ability to track recent updates and improvements in the documentation, impacting their overall experience.
