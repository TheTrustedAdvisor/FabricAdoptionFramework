This commit: Delete docs/methodologies/1-strategy/.DS_Store

# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Remove unnecessary .DS_Store file (8b01fcb)

- **[Impact: Low]** No reader-visible documentation changes.  
   
Why it matters: The deletion of a non-essential file does not impact the content or usability of the documentation for readers.
