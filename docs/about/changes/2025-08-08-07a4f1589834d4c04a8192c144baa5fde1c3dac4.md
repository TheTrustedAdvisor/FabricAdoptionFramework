# Changes â€“ 2025-08-08: Expand Foundational Methodologies Section (07a4f15)

- **[Impact: Medium]** The "Foundational methodologies" category has been updated to be expanded instead of collapsed, making it easier for readers to access the methodologies listed under this category.  
   [details](/docs/about/changes/2025-08-08_foundational_methodologies_update)  
   [commit](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commit/07a4f1589834d4c04a8192c144baa5fde1c3dac4)  

Why it matters: This change enhances the user experience by providing immediate visibility into foundational methodologies without requiring additional clicks.
