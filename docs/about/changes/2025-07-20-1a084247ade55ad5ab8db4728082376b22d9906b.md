# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Establish Fabric Adoption Framework documentation (1a08424)

### Summary of Changes

- Removed several documentation files related to the Fabric Adoption Framework, including introductory content and methodologies.
- Deleted the document titled "What is the Fabric Adoption Framework?", which provided an overview and key considerations for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- Removed the guide on "Define your mission and objectives for Fabric adoption," which included templates and examples for setting clear goals.
- Eliminated the document on "Define your Microsoft Fabric strategy team," detailing roles and responsibilities for effective governance and alignment.
- Removed the article "Determine your motivations for adopting Microsoft Fabric," which outlined the importance of aligning business and IT strategies.
- Deleted the "Prepare your organization for Microsoft Fabric adoption" document, which provided guidance on aligning leadership and operational readiness.
- Overall, these deletions streamline the documentation but may reduce the available resources for users seeking guidance on Microsoft Fabric adoption.

Why it matters: The removal of these documents may necessitate the creation of new resources or updates to existing materials to ensure users have the necessary guidance for successful adoption.
