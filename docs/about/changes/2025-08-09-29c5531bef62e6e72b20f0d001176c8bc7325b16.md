This commit: Delete docs/about/changes directory

# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Remove About Changes Documentation Directory (29c5531)

- **[Impact: High]** The entire `docs/about/changes` directory has been deleted, which removes all previous change logs and documentation history from the site.  
  [details](/docs/about/changes/2025-08-09-1)  
  [commit](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commit/29c5531bef62e6e72b20f0d001176c8bc7325b16)

- **[Impact: Medium]** The sidebar categories "1 - Define strategy" and "Foundational methodologies" have been set to be collapsed by default, improving the sidebar's visual organization but requiring users to expand these categories to view their contents.

- **[Impact: Medium]** Several key documents, including those covering the Fabric Adoption Framework, mission, goals, and organizational preparation, have been removed, which may hinder users' understanding of the implementation process.

- **[Impact: Medium]** The visibility of foundational methodologies has been improved by changing the "collapsed" attribute from true to false, allowing users to see this section without needing to expand it.

- **[Impact: Low]** The removal of the `.DS_Store` file from the documentation directory has been completed, which helps maintain a cleaner project structure but does not impact user-facing content.
