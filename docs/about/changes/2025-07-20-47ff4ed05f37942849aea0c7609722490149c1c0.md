# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add initial .DS_Store file (47ff4ed)

### Release Notes Summary for Commit 47ff4ed

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been created in the directory `docs/methodologies/1-strategy`.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file used by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This file does not contain any relevant documentation or content for users.
- The inclusion of `.DS_Store` files is common in macOS environments, but they are typically not necessary for version control.
- Future commits may need to address the presence of this file to maintain a clean repository.

Why it matters: The presence of unnecessary system files can clutter the repository and may lead to confusion for contributors.
