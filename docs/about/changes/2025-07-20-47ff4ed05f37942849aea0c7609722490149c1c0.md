# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add initial .DS_Store file (47ff4ed)

## Release Notes for Commit 47ff4ed

- A new file named `.DS_Store` has been added to the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory.
- The `.DS_Store` file is a system file created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- This file is typically used to manage folder view settings on macOS.
- The addition of this file does not affect the content or structure of the documentation.
- It is included to maintain consistency for users working on macOS systems.
- Other operating systems may ignore this file, so it should not impact cross-platform functionality.
- The presence of this file can help improve user experience for macOS users by preserving their folder settings.

Why it matters: This change ensures that macOS users have a consistent experience when accessing the documentation folder.
