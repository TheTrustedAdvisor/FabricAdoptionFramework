## Summary of Changes to Fabric Adoption Strategy Assessment

- The article has been revised to provide a more structured approach for evaluating and improving the Microsoft Fabric adoption strategy.
- It now includes a clear audience definition, targeting platform owners, architects, and governance teams responsible for Fabric implementation.
- New resources are added, such as a repeatable assessment method, a maturity model, a gap analysis template, and example KPIs/OKRs for tracking progress.
- Principles for successful Fabric adoption are outlined, emphasising a business-first approach, product thinking, and the importance of automation.
- The assessment process has been expanded to include detailed steps for preparation, maturity evaluation, gap identification, action planning, and reassessment.
- Twelve dimensions for assessment have been specified, covering areas like strategy alignment, governance, security, and data management.
- Action plan examples are provided for each dimension, guiding teams on how to address identified gaps.
- A 90-day adoption playbook is introduced, outlining a phased approach for implementation and scaling.
- The document encourages regular reassessment to ensure alignment with evolving organisational goals and capabilities.
