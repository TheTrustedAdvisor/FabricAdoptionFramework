# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Remove unnecessary .DS_Store file (4dec936)

## Summary of Changes

- The file `.DS_Store` located in the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory has been deleted.
- `.DS_Store` files are system files created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- The removal of this file helps to keep the repository clean and free of unnecessary system files.
- This change reduces clutter in the documentation directory, making it easier to navigate.
- The deletion aligns with best practices for version control by avoiding the inclusion of local environment files.

Why it matters: Maintaining a clean repository improves collaboration and ensures that only relevant files are included in the project.
