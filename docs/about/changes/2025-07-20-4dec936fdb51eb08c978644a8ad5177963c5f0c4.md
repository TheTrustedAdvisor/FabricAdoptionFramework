# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Remove unnecessary .DS_Store file (4dec936)

### Summary of Changes

- The file `.DS_Store` located in the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory has been deleted.
- `.DS_Store` files are created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder, such as icon positions and view options.
- This deletion helps to keep the repository clean by removing unnecessary system files that do not contribute to the project's documentation.
- The removal of this file prevents potential confusion for other contributors who may not need or want these system-specific files.
- By eliminating `.DS_Store`, the project maintains a more streamlined and professional appearance.

Why it matters: Removing unnecessary files enhances repository clarity and usability for all contributors.
