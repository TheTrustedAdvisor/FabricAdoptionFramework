# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Add 'Detailed Changelog' category to docs (a68f7ee)

## Summary of Changes

- A new JSON file has been added to the documentation directory.
- The file is named `_category_.json` and contains metadata for a "Detailed Changelog."
- The changelog is labelled as "Detailed Changelog" for clarity.
- It is positioned first in the list of categories.
- The changelog section is set to be collapsed by default for a cleaner interface.

Why it matters: This addition improves the organisation of the documentation by clearly categorising change logs, enhancing user navigation and understanding of updates.
