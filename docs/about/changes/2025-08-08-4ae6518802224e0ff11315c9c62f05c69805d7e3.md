This commit: Added license

# Changes â€“ 2025-08-08: Add License Information to Documentation (4ae6518)

- **[Impact: Low]** No reader-visible documentation changes.  

Why it matters: The addition of the license section helps ensure users understand the legal terms under which the documentation and framework are provided.
