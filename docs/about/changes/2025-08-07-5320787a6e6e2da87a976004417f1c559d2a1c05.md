# Changes â€“ 2025-08-07: Collapse sidebar categories in documentation (5320787)

### Release Notes Summary for Commit 5320787a6e6e2da87a976004417f1c559d2a1c05

- Updated the sidebar configuration for the "1 - Define strategy" methodology.
- Changed the "collapsed" state from false to true, meaning this section will now be collapsed by default.
- Adjusted the sidebar settings for the "Foundational methodologies" category in a similar manner.
- The "collapsed" state for this category has also been set to true, making it initially hidden.
- These changes aim to streamline the user interface by reducing the amount of visible information upon initial access.
- Users will now have a cleaner view, with the option to expand sections as needed.
- This update may enhance navigation and focus on key methodologies without overwhelming users.

Why it matters: These adjustments improve user experience by decluttering the interface and allowing for a more organised presentation of content.
