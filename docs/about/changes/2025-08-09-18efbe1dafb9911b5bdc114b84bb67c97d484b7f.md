### Summary of Changes

- Several important documents related to the Fabric Adoption Framework have been removed, including guides on defining missions, objectives, and strategy teams.
- The deleted documents covered key topics essential for successfully implementing Microsoft Fabric, such as motivation identification and organisational preparation.
- The removal of these resources may hinder companies in developing clear strategies for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- Important best practices and templates that previously supported organisations in their implementation efforts are no longer available.
- The changes may lead to increased confusion regarding roles and responsibilities in the adoption process.
- New visual content has been added to enhance documentation, improving user experience and understanding.
- The addition of a new image aims to support the documentation visually, making complex information more accessible.
- The presence of unnecessary files, such as `.DS_Store`, has been addressed to maintain a cleaner project structure.
- The overall documentation strategy appears to be shifting towards a more streamlined and focused approach.
- These changes may result in a more efficient and clear documentation experience for users.

Why it matters: These updates aim to improve the clarity and effectiveness of the documentation related to Microsoft Fabric adoption, ensuring that organisations can navigate the implementation process more effectively.
