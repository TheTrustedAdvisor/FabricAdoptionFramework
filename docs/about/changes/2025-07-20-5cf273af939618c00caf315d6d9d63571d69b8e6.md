# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Remove unnecessary .DS_Store file (5cf273a)

### Summary of Changes

- The file `.DS_Store` located in the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory has been deleted.
- `.DS_Store` files are system files created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder.
- Removing this file helps to keep the repository clean and free from unnecessary system files.
- This change contributes to better version control and reduces clutter in the documentation directory.
- It ensures that only relevant documentation files are included in the repository.

Why it matters: Keeping the repository free from extraneous files enhances maintainability and clarity for all contributors.
