# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Add initial documentation for Fabric framework (3948fa7)

## Summary of Changes

- Removed several documentation files related to the Fabric Adoption Framework, including introductory content and strategic methodologies.
- Deleted the document explaining what the Fabric Adoption Framework is, which provided an overview and key considerations for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- Removed guides on defining mission and objectives, determining motivations for adoption, and preparing an organisation for Microsoft Fabric implementation.
- Eliminated content detailing the roles and responsibilities of a Fabric strategy team, which was essential for aligning business and technical objectives.
- The overview of the Fabric adoption strategy, including steps for assessment and stakeholder alignment, has also been removed.
- The changes may impact users seeking guidance on how to effectively adopt and implement Microsoft Fabric within their organisations.

Why it matters: These deletions may hinder users' ability to understand and execute a structured approach to Microsoft Fabric adoption, potentially affecting their strategic planning and implementation efforts.
