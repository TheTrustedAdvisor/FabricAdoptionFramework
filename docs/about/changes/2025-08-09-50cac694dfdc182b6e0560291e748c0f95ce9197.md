# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Remove key documents for strategy clarity (50cac69)

## Summary of Changes

- Multiple important documents related to the Microsoft Fabric Adoption Framework have been removed, including guides on defining missions, objectives, and team structures.
- The deletions suggest a possible restructuring of the documentation to enhance clarity and focus on essential aspects of the Microsoft Fabric adoption.
- Key topics such as risk management, innovation promotion, and efficiency improvement were previously covered in the deleted documents.
- The absence of these resources may hinder new users and organisations looking to implement Microsoft Fabric effectively.
- A new image file has been added to the documentation, which may enhance visual understanding of the content.
- Several `.DS_Store` files, which are system files created by macOS, have been added and subsequently removed to maintain repository cleanliness.
- The changes indicate a shift towards a more streamlined documentation approach, prioritising relevant content over unnecessary files.
- The removal of documents could lead to confusion regarding implementation strategies and success measurement for Microsoft Fabric.
- The focus on strategic alignment and leadership support remains crucial for the successful adoption of Microsoft Fabric.
- Future updates may introduce new content that addresses the gaps left by the deleted documents.

Why it matters: These changes are significant as they impact the effectiveness of Microsoft Fabric adoption strategies and the overall clarity of the documentation for users.
