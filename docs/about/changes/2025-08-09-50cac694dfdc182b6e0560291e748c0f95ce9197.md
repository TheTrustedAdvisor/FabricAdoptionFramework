## Summary of Changes

- Multiple important documents related to the Microsoft Fabric Adoption Framework have been removed, including guides on defining missions, objectives, and team structures.
- The deletion of these documents suggests a potential strategic realignment, focusing on streamlining content to enhance clarity and accessibility.
- Key concepts such as risk mitigation, innovation promotion, and efficiency improvement were addressed in the removed materials, which may hinder guidance for users.
- New visual elements, including a PNG image, have been added to enhance documentation clarity and user experience.
- The `.DS_Store` file, a macOS system file, has been removed to maintain a cleaner repository and avoid confusion among users on different operating systems.
- The absence of these documents may lead to a lack of clear guidelines for implementing and planning the Fabric adoption process.
- The changes indicate a shift towards a more focused and strategic approach to Microsoft Fabric adoption, which is essential for aligning business goals with technology capabilities.
- Users may need to adapt to new or updated documents that replace the removed content, which could be presented in a different format or focus.
- The emphasis on continuous improvement and regular strategy reviews is highlighted as crucial for successful adoption.
- Overall, these changes aim to enhance the efficiency and clarity of the documentation, ensuring that organisations are well-prepared for the challenges of digital transformation.

Why it matters: These changes are crucial for ensuring that the introduction of Microsoft Fabric is strategically aligned and effectively implemented, ultimately leading to better utilisation of the platform and increased business value.
