# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Remove unnecessary .DS_Store file (deefd33)

### Release Notes Summary

- The file `.DS_Store` located in the `docs/methodologies/1-strategy/` directory has been removed.
- `.DS_Store` files are created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder, such as icon positions and view settings.
- This deletion helps to keep the repository clean and free from unnecessary files that do not contribute to the project's documentation or methodologies.
- Removing such files can improve the overall organisation and maintainability of the documentation directory.
- This change is part of ongoing efforts to streamline project resources and ensure only relevant files are retained in the repository.

Why it matters: Maintaining a clean repository enhances collaboration and reduces confusion for contributors.
