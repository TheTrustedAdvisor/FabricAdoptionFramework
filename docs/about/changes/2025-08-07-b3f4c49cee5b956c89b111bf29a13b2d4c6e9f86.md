# Changes â€“ 2025-08-07: Remove Fabric adoption strategy document (b3f4c49)

## Summary of Changes

- The document titled "Assess your Fabric adoption strategy" has been removed from the repository.
- This document previously provided guidance on evaluating and improving Microsoft Fabric adoption strategies.
- It included structured methodologies for assessing maturity, identifying gaps, and defining action plans.
- Key principles for successful Fabric adoption, such as a business-first approach and the importance of automation, were outlined.
- The assessment process covered preparation, evaluation, gap identification, action planning, and reassessment.
- A maturity model was included to help organisations score their progress across various dimensions.
- The document also featured templates for gap analysis, action plans, and a 90-day adoption playbook.
- Relevant roles and responsibilities for governance and execution were detailed within the document.
- The removal of this document may impact users seeking structured guidance on Fabric adoption.
- Users will need to seek alternative resources or documentation for similar information.

Why it matters: The deletion of this document removes a critical resource for organisations looking to effectively adopt and integrate Microsoft Fabric into their operations.
