# Changes â€“ 2025-08-08: Expand Foundational Methodologies Section (7eabbab)

- **[Impact: Medium]** The "Foundational methodologies" section has been updated to be expanded rather than collapsed, improving accessibility for readers.  
   [details](/docs/about/changes/2025-08-08-foundational-methodologies-expanded)  
   [commit](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commit/7eabbab4313295ad615b7062e232478484070c38)  

Why it matters: This change enhances the user experience by making important methodologies more visible and easier to navigate.
