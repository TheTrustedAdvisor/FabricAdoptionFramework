# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Revise documentation for Fabric framework (c6fd0e8)

## Summary of Changes

- Multiple documentation files related to the Microsoft Fabric Adoption Framework have been removed, including key guides on defining mission and objectives, forming a strategy team, and understanding motivations for adoption.
- The deletions suggest a restructuring or simplification of the content, potentially indicating a shift in focus or methodology for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- New documentation files have been created to provide initial guidance on the Fabric Adoption Framework, aiming to clarify strategic aspects and improve user understanding.
- A new image file has been added to enhance the visual representation within the documentation, likely aimed at improving user engagement.
- Unnecessary `.DS_Store` files, which are system files created by macOS, have been removed to maintain a cleaner project structure and avoid confusion for contributors.
- The changes reflect an effort to streamline the documentation and focus on essential content that supports effective adoption of Microsoft Fabric.
- The removal of certain documents may impact how organisations approach the adoption process, as foundational resources are no longer directly accessible.
- Overall, the updates aim to enhance clarity, focus, and practical guidance for organisations implementing Microsoft Fabric.

Why it matters: These changes could significantly influence how organisations adopt Microsoft Fabric, ensuring that the remaining resources are relevant and aligned with their strategic goals.
