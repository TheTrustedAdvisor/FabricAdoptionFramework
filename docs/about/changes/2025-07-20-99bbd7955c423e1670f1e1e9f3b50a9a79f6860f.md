- Key documents that were deleted include:
  - **What is the Fabric Adoption Framework?**: This document provided an introduction and best practices for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
  - **Define your mission and objectives for Fabric adoption**: This outlined the importance of having a clear mission and measurable objectives for adoption.
  - **Define your Microsoft Fabric strategy team**: This described the roles and responsibilities needed for a successful adoption strategy.
