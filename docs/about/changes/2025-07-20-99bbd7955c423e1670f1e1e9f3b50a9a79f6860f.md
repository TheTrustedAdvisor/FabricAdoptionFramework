# Changes â€“ 2025-07-20: Establish initial Fabric Adoption Framework documentation (99bbd79)

## Summary of Changes

- Removed multiple documentation files related to the Fabric Adoption Framework, including introductory and strategic planning documents.
- Deleted content explaining the Fabric Adoption Framework, which provided best practices for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- The sections on defining mission and objectives, strategy team roles, and motivations for adoption were also removed.
- Guidance on preparing an organisation for Microsoft Fabric adoption, including leadership alignment and operating model readiness, has been eliminated.
- The overall structure and content aimed at helping organisations strategise and implement Microsoft Fabric effectively have been removed.

Why it matters: These changes indicate a significant reduction in available resources for organisations seeking to adopt Microsoft Fabric, potentially impacting their ability to align business goals with technology initiatives.
