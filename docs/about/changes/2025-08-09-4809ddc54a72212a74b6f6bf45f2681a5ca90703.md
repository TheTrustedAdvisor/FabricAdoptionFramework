# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Enhance MDX sanitizer rules and logic (4809ddc)

### Summary of Changes

- Introduced a new sanitiser function to improve the handling of Markdown and MDX content.
- Enhanced the sanitisation rules to escape specific characters, particularly the less-than sign ("&lt;"), to prevent issues with JSX parsing.
- Added multiple rules to cover various scenarios where the less-than sign may cause conflicts, such as:
  - Characters that do not start valid HTML/MDX tags.
  - Less-than signs directly before digits.
  - Lines beginning with a date immediately after a less-than sign.
- Included a rule to prevent accidental JSX from constructs starting with "&lt;" at the beginning of lines.
- Adjusted the file permissions for the changelog documentation file to ensure proper access.

Why it matters: These changes enhance the robustness of Markdown processing, reducing potential rendering issues and improving overall content quality.
