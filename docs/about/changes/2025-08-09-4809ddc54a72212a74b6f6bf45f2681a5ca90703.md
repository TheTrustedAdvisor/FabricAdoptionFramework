# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Enhance MDX sanitizer with new rules (4809ddc)

## Release Notes for Commit 4809ddc54a72212a74b6f6bf45f2681a5ca90703

- Introduced a new sanitisation process in the workflow for handling MDX content.
- Enhanced the `sanitize_for_mdx` function to escape various MDX-hostile constructs more effectively.
- Added multiple rules for escaping the less-than symbol ("&lt;") to prevent it from being interpreted as JSX.
- Implemented specific rules to cover cases where "&lt;" appears before digits or at the start of lines, ensuring better compatibility with MDX.
- Adjusted the file permissions for the changelog documentation file to improve accessibility.
- Updated documentation to reflect changes made on 7th August 2025.

Why it matters: These updates improve the handling of MDX content, reducing the risk of rendering issues and enhancing overall document integrity.
