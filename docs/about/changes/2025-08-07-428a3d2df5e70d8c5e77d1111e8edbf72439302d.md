# Changes â€“ 2025-08-07: Collapse sidebar categories in documentation (428a3d2)

### Release Notes Summary for Commit 428a3d2d

- Updated the sidebar configuration for two methodology documents.
- The "1 - Define strategy" category is now set to be collapsed by default.
- The "Foundational methodologies" category is also set to be collapsed by default.
- These changes affect the user interface of the documentation, particularly in how methodologies are displayed.
- The adjustments aim to improve the organisation and accessibility of content within the sidebar.
- Users will need to expand these categories to view their contents, streamlining the initial view.

Why it matters: These changes enhance the user experience by decluttering the sidebar, making it easier to navigate through the documentation.
