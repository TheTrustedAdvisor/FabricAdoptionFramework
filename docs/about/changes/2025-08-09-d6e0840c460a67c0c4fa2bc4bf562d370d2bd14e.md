# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarify capacity overrun and MTTR targets (d6e0840)

### Summary of Changes

- Corrected the phrasing of the target for "capacity overrun" to "less than 2% monthly by Q4" for clarity.
- Adjusted the target for "MTTR for P1 incidents" to "less than 2h by Q4" to improve understanding.
- Both adjustments aim to enhance the precision of the mission statement in the document.
- The changes ensure that the key results are clearly defined and easily auditable.
- These modifications are part of the ongoing effort to refine strategic methodologies.

Why it matters: Clear and precise language in mission statements helps teams understand their objectives and track progress effectively.
