# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarify targets for capacity overrun and MTTR (d6e0840)

## Summary of Changes

- Corrected phrasing in the document regarding capacity overrun targets.
- Changed "less than 2%" from a numerical format to a more explicit wording for clarity.
- Updated the target for capacity overrun to be "less than 2% monthly by Q4".
- Similarly, adjusted the phrasing for the MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) target for P1 incidents to "less than 2 hours by Q4".
- Ensured consistency in the language used for target descriptions throughout the document.
- The changes aim to enhance clarity and understanding of key performance indicators (KPIs) for stakeholders.
- The document remains focused on defining mission statements and objectives within the context of strategy methodologies.

Why it matters: Clear and precise language in documentation helps ensure that all stakeholders have a common understanding of objectives and performance metrics.
