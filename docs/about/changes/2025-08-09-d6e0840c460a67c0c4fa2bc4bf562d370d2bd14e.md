This commit: Unexpected Character

# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarified capacity overrun and MTTR targets (d6e0840)

- **[Impact: Medium]** The wording in the "Target & Date" column for the key results has been updated for clarity, changing "100% by **Q3**" to "less than 2% monthly by **Q4**". This improves the readability and understanding of the objectives.
