This commit: Unexpected Character

# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Clarified target metrics for objectives (d6e0840)

- **[Impact: Medium] Content update (Governance/access)**: Updated wording in the "Define Your Mission and Objectives" section to clarify the target for capacity overrun, changing "less than 2%" to "less than 2% monthly." This improves readability and ensures consistency in language used throughout the document.
