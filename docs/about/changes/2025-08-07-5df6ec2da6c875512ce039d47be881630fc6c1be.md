# Changes â€“ 2025-08-07: Remove "Assess your Fabric adoption strategy" article (5df6ec2)

- **[Impact: High] Content update**: The article "Assess your Fabric adoption strategy" has been completely removed, which eliminates a key resource for evaluating and evolving Microsoft Fabric adoption strategies.  
   [details](/docs/about/changes/2025-08-07-assess-your-fabric-adoption-strategy)  
   [commit](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commit/5df6ec2da6c875512ce039d47be881630fc6c1be)

- **[Impact: Low] No reader-visible documentation changes.**  
Why it matters: The removal of the article may impact users seeking guidance on Fabric adoption strategies, limiting their access to structured evaluation methods and resources.
