- **Loss of Strategic Guidance**: The deleted documents contained critical strategic guidance and best practices that are now unavailable, potentially hindering effective implementation.
- **Impact on Team Organisation**: Information regarding roles and responsibilities within strategy teams has been removed, complicating team organisation.
- **Absence of Success Metrics**: Guidelines for measuring the success of the Fabric adoption process have been eliminated, making it difficult to track progress.
- **Need for New Resources**: There may be a requirement for new documentation or resources to fill the gaps left by the deletions.
- **Visual Enhancements Added**: New images have been introduced to improve the visual representation of content in the documentation.
- **Clarity and Accessibility**: The addition of visual elements aims to enhance user experience and make complex information easier to understand.
