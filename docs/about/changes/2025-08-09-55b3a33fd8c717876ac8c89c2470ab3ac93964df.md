# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Enhance MDX sanitization for changelogs (55b3a33)

### Summary of Changes

- Updated the GitHub Actions workflow for assembling the changelog to improve MDX safety.
- Introduced sanitisation functions to escape MDX-hostile constructs, ensuring that the content is safe for rendering.
- Added functionality to split and normalise front matter in markdown files, enhancing the handling of document metadata.
- Enhanced logging to provide clearer feedback on the sanitisation process, including the number of replacements made.
- Changed file permissions for several markdown files to ensure they are executable.
- Improved the format of the auto-generated header in the 'whats-new.md' file to include the current timestamp.
- Adjusted the logic to handle cases where front matter is not detected, ensuring that the entire text is sanitised as a fallback.
- Enhanced error handling during the repair of existing change files to prevent failures from halting the process.

Why it matters: These changes enhance the reliability and safety of the documentation process, ensuring that generated content is properly formatted and secure for use.
