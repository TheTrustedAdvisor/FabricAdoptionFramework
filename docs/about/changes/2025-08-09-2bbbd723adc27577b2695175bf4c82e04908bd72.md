# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Remove key documents on Microsoft Fabric (2bbbd72)

# Release Notes Summary

- **Removal of Key Documents**: Several important documents related to the Fabric Adoption Framework and strategic guidance have been deleted, including those defining mission, objectives, and team structures.
- **Impact on Strategic Planning**: The deleted documents contained essential information for organisations planning to adopt Microsoft Fabric, including best practices and templates.
- **Loss of Guidance**: With the removal of these resources, organisations may struggle to establish clear strategies and objectives for their Fabric adoption.
- **Risk of Information Gap**: The absence of these documents could create gaps in knowledge that hinder effective implementation and support.
- **Lack of Support for Teams**: Teams working on Microsoft Fabric adoption will have less direction and resources to guide their efforts.
- **Potential Confusion**: New users may find it challenging to navigate the adoption process without the previously available documentation.
- **Shift in Focus**: The changes suggest a potential shift towards a more streamlined approach, possibly prioritising governance and compliance over detailed guidance.
- **Increased Difficulty in Adoption**: The removal of these documents could complicate the adoption process, making it harder for organisations to align their goals with the implementation of Microsoft Fabric.
- **Visual Documentation Update**: A new image file has been added to enhance the visual clarity of the documentation, aiding user understanding.
- **Clean-up of Unnecessary Files**: The deletion of `.DS_Store` files helps maintain a tidy repository, reducing confusion and improving collaboration.

Why it matters: These changes significantly affect how organisations plan and implement Microsoft Fabric, potentially hindering their success in leveraging the platform effectively.
