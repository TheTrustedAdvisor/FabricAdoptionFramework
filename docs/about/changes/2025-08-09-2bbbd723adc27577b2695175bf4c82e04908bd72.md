# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Remove key documents on Microsoft Fabric (2bbbd72)

# Release Notes Summary

- **Document Deletions**: Several key documents related to the Fabric Adoption Framework have been removed, including those on defining missions, objectives, and strategic teams.
- **Impact on Strategic Planning**: The deleted documents contained important guidelines for strategic alignment and preparation for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- **Loss of Best Practices**: The removal of these documents eliminates best practices and templates that were essential for successful implementation.
- **Risk of Information Gap**: Without these resources, organisations may struggle to develop clear strategies for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- **Reduced Support for Teams**: Teams working on Microsoft Fabric implementation now have less guidance and support.
- **Uncertainty for New Users**: New users may find it challenging to navigate the adoption process without the previously available resources.
- **Visual Additions**: New images have been added to enhance documentation clarity and user experience.
- **File Management**: Unnecessary system files (e.g., `.DS_Store`) have been removed to maintain a clean project structure.
- **Version Control Improvements**: The removal of irrelevant files helps reduce potential conflicts in version control systems.
- **Focus on Governance**: The changes may indicate a shift towards a more governance-focused approach in the documentation.

Why it matters: These changes could significantly affect how organisations implement Microsoft Fabric, potentially hindering their success and efficiency.
