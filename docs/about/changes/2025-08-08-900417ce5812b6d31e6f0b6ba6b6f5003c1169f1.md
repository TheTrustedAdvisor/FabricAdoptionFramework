# Changes â€“ 2025-08-08: Expand Foundational Methodologies Section (900417c)

- **[Impact: Medium]** The "Foundational methodologies" category has been updated to be expanded instead of collapsed, making it easier for readers to access related methodologies directly from the main navigation.  
   [details](/docs/about/changes/2025-08-08-foundational-methodologies)  
   [commit](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commit/900417ce5812b6d31e6f0b6ba6b6f5003c1169f1)  

Why it matters: This change enhances the user experience by improving the visibility and accessibility of important methodologies within the documentation.
