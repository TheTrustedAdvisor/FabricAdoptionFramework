# Changes â€“ 2025-08-07: Collapse sidebar categories in documentation (6d7b646)

### Summary of Changes

- Updated the "1 - Define strategy" category in the strategy methodology documentation.
- Changed the "collapsed" property from false to true, meaning this section will now be collapsed by default.
- Adjusted the "Foundational methodologies" category in the general methodologies documentation.
- Similarly, set the "collapsed" property from false to true for this category as well.
- These changes affect how users interact with the sidebar in the documentation interface.
- Collapsing these sections may improve user experience by reducing clutter and allowing for a more streamlined navigation.

Why it matters: This adjustment enhances the usability of the documentation by making it easier for users to navigate through different methodologies.
