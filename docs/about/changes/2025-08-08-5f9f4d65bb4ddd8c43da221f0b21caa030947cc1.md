This commit: Sync published docs from dev repo

# Changes â€“ 2025-08-08: Sync Bicep files and diagrams from dev (5f9f4d6)

- **[Impact: Low]** No reader-visible documentation changes.

Why it matters: The documentation remains consistent and unchanged for readers, ensuring they can rely on the existing content without confusion.
