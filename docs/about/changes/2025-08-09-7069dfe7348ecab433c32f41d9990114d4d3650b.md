# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Correct wording for budget overrun thresholds (7069dfe)

### Summary of Changes

- Corrected the phrasing in the "Operations & FinOps" section regarding capacity budget alerts for clarity.
- Changed "less than 5% overrun" to "less than 5% overrun" to maintain consistency in terminology.
- Updated key result (KR2) in the OKRs section to use "less than" instead of the symbol "&lt;" for better readability.
- Ensured that all instances of performance metrics are clearly stated to avoid ambiguity.
- The document continues to emphasise the importance of monitoring capacity and costs effectively.

Why it matters: These changes enhance the clarity and consistency of the document, making it easier for users to understand the operational metrics and expectations.
