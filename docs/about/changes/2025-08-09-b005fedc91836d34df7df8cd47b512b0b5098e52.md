## Summary of Changes

- The removal of these documents indicates a potential shift in focus towards updating or streamlining the content to better align with current strategies.
- Important best practices and structured approaches for implementing Microsoft Fabric are no longer available, which may hinder clarity and consistency in future projects.
- New visual content has been added, including a PNG image intended to enhance the documentation and improve user experience.
- The addition of visual elements aims to make complex information more accessible and engaging for users.
- The `.DS_Store` files, which are system files created by macOS, have been removed to maintain a cleaner repository and avoid unnecessary clutter.
- The changes suggest a move towards a more streamlined approach to documentation, focusing on essential information and reducing redundancy.
- There is an emphasis on the need for strategic clarity and preparation for organizations adopting Microsoft Fabric, despite the removal of some resources.
- Future updates may be necessary to fill the gaps left by the deleted documents and to ensure that users have access to relevant guidance.
