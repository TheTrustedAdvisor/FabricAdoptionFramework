# Changes â€“ 2025-08-09: Remove Microsoft Fabric adoption documents (b005fed)

## Summary of Changes

- Several key documents related to the Microsoft Fabric Adoption Framework have been deleted, including guides on defining missions, goals, and strategies.
- The removed documents covered essential topics such as team formation and motivation for adopting Microsoft Fabric.
- These deletions may indicate a strategic shift or simplification in the approach to Microsoft Fabric adoption.
- The absence of these documents could lead to a lack of clarity and structure for teams trying to implement Microsoft Fabric.
- Important best practices and guidelines for successful implementation are no longer available, which may hinder progress.
- New visual content has been added, including a PNG image to enhance the documentation's user experience.
- The addition of images aims to improve the accessibility and understanding of the documentation for users.
- A `.DS_Store` file, which is not relevant to the documentation, has been removed to maintain a cleaner repository.
- The repository's organisation has been improved by eliminating unnecessary files, which aids collaboration.
- Future updates may be needed to fill the gaps left by the deleted documents and to enhance the overall documentation structure.

Why it matters: These changes impact how organisations approach the adoption of Microsoft Fabric, potentially affecting their efficiency and success in implementation.
