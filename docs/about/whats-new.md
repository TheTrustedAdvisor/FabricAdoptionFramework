# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. We’ve synchronized new content to ensure that you have the latest insights and resources at your fingertips. This includes a fresh set of strategy methodology documents that we’ve published, which will help you navigate your adoption journey more effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md). 

We’ve also made significant improvements to our navigation structure. By collapsing sidebar categories, we’ve aimed to create a clearer, more streamlined experience for you while exploring our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, which not only clarifies usage rights but also enhances transparency in our governance (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). 

These changes are all about making your journey smoother and more intuitive as you explore the framework. I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and input. Your feedback is invaluable, and together, we’re creating a resource that truly meets your needs. I can’t wait to see how these updates will help you in your adoption efforts!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some significant updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out our initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement and utilize the framework in your projects. This new content aims to provide you with clear guidance and valuable insights as you embark on your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to introducing new content, we also made some important housekeeping changes by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our purpose. This streamlining helps ensure that you can easily find the most relevant and up-to-date information without wading through unnecessary clutter (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). 

These updates are not just about new content; they reflect our commitment to improving your experience and making our documentation more user-friendly. I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these changes possible. I hope you find the new resources helpful as you navigate the adoption framework!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" section from our documentation. While it served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make navigation more intuitive for you. This adjustment means that you can now find updates and changes more seamlessly integrated within the relevant sections of the documentation, rather than having to check a separate area. It’s all about making your journey through our resources smoother and more enjoyable (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe that simplifying our structure will help you focus on the information that matters most, without the distraction of redundant sections. By integrating updates directly into the relevant content, we hope to create a more cohesive reading experience that feels more connected to your needs. It’s a small change, but I expect it to have a positive impact on how you engage with our documentation. Thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision; your feedback is invaluable in shaping a resource that truly serves you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we continue to evolve, I’m eager to hear how these changes resonate with you. Your insights help us refine our approach and ensure that we remain aligned with your expectations. Here’s to a more streamlined and user-friendly experience as we move forward together!
