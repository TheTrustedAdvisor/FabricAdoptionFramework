## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us, and I’m thrilled to share some of the exciting updates we’ve made to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. We’ve synchronized new content from our development repository, which means you’ll find fresh insights and resources that are more aligned with our current strategies (Read more ›). This update not only enriches our content but also enhances your experience as you navigate through the materials.

In our ongoing effort to make the documentation more user-friendly, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for improved clarity. This change makes it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed by too many options (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve added a License section and link to the navigation menu, ensuring that you have quick access to important information about our documentation's usage (Read more ›). These adjustments reflect our commitment to creating a more streamlined and accessible experience for everyone involved in the Fabric adoption journey.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m thrilled to share some exciting updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant strides in shaping our documentation to better serve you. We introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices.

In tandem with this new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining helps ensure that you can find the most pertinent information without wading through outdated materials. I truly believe that these changes will make your journey through our documentation smoother and more intuitive (Read more ›) [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made a significant change to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this section served a purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need. This change means that you can now navigate our documentation without the distraction of repetitive updates, allowing for a smoother and more focused reading experience. If you're curious about the specifics of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I genuinely believe that this adjustment will help us all stay more connected to the core content that matters most. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to foster a more cohesive understanding of our framework and its resources. I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to this decision and the ongoing improvements we are making together. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable to us.

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. I hope you find the updated structure refreshing and easier to navigate. Thank you for being a part of our community!
