We also added a License section and a link to it in our navigation menu, making it easier for you to understand the usage rights and guidelines (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we collapsed the sidebar categories, which should help you navigate our content more smoothly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d).

## July 2025

Hello everyone! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some significant updates that I believe will enhance your experience with our documentation. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement and utilize our tools. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to integrate our framework into your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter our resources and ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I want to take a moment to thank our contributors who have worked diligently to bring these updates to life; your efforts truly make a difference.

As we move forward, I expect these changes will not only improve your navigation through the documentation but also provide clearer insights into how to adopt our framework effectively. The goal is to create a welcoming space where you can easily access the information you need to succeed. I’m excited for you to explore these updates and look forward to hearing your feedback!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. While this may seem like a loss at first glance, we’ve streamlined our content to ensure that you can find the most relevant information without sifting through outdated updates. This decision was made with your needs in mind, as we want to keep our documentation clear and focused on what truly matters to you. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I genuinely believe that simplifying our navigation will make it easier for you to access the information you need quickly. By consolidating our updates, we aim to create a more cohesive experience that allows you to dive straight into the content that supports your journey with the framework. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community members who have provided invaluable feedback throughout this process. Your insights have been instrumental in shaping a documentation experience that better serves all of us.

As we move forward, I am excited to see how these changes will positively impact your engagement with our resources. We are committed to continuously improving and adapting our documentation to meet your needs, and I hope you find these updates refreshing and helpful. Let’s keep the conversation going—your thoughts and experiences are always welcome!
