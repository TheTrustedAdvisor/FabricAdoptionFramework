# What's new

## August 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation, starting with the addition of a new License section, which you can now find in the navigation menu. This change is crucial as it provides clarity on how you can use our resources, fostering a better understanding of your rights and responsibilities (Read more ›).

Additionally, we’ve synchronized our content to ensure that you have access to the latest strategies and methodologies for Fabric adoption. This means you’ll find more comprehensive and up-to-date information throughout the site, making it easier for you to navigate and implement these strategies effectively. The collapse of sidebar categories also plays a big role in enhancing clarity, allowing you to focus on what matters most without unnecessary distractions (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable in shaping the direction of our documentation, and I truly appreciate the collaborative spirit that drives us forward. I hope these updates make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even smoother and more enjoyable!

## July 2025

Hello dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the wonderful updates we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, which means you now have access to foundational resources that will guide you through the adoption process. This is a significant step forward in making our framework more accessible and user-friendly, allowing you to dive right into the materials that matter most to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files related to the Fabric Framework. This decluttering helps ensure that you’re only seeing the most relevant and up-to-date information, making navigation much smoother and more intuitive (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I believe these changes will not only improve your journey through our documentation but also foster a stronger understanding of the framework itself.

A heartfelt thank you goes out to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. It’s your insights that help us create a better experience for everyone. I’m excited to see how these updates will positively impact your exploration of the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience as you navigate through the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant and up-to-date information without any distractions. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I want to emphasize that this change is all about you, our community. By simplifying our navigation and focusing on the essential content, we hope to make it easier for you to engage with the resources that matter most. It’s important to us that you feel supported and informed as you work through the framework, and we believe this adjustment will help us achieve that goal. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and provided feedback; your voices truly matter in shaping our documentation.

As we move forward, we expect this streamlined approach to foster a more intuitive user experience, allowing you to find what you need quickly and efficiently. I’m excited about the positive impact this will have on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Let’s continue to grow and learn together!
