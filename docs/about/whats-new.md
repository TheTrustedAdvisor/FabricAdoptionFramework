# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we focused on refining our content and navigation to make it even easier for you to find what you need. We’ve added a new License section to our documentation, ensuring you have clear access to important licensing information (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve revamped our navigation menu to include a direct link to this section, making it more accessible than ever (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we’ve collapsed some sidebar categories, which should help you navigate our resources with greater ease (Read more ›). We also updated our logo to better reflect our identity, and we synchronized various strategy methodology documents to ensure you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips (Read more ›). These changes matter because they not only streamline your journey through our documentation but also ensure that you have the most relevant information as you adopt and implement the Fabric framework.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for your invaluable input and support. Your engagement helps us create a more user-friendly and informative experience. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates impact your work and enrich your understanding of the Fabric Adoption Framework!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for a more structured and supportive approach to navigating our resources. This is a significant step forward, as it provides you with clearer guidance on how to adopt and implement our framework effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current direction. This cleanup helps streamline your navigation and ensures that you’re accessing the most relevant and up-to-date information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I genuinely appreciate the contributions from our community that made these changes possible, and I hope you find the refreshed structure much more user-friendly.

As we continue to build upon this foundation, I anticipate that these updates will foster a more engaging and effective learning environment for everyone involved. Your feedback is invaluable, and I encourage you to explore the new content and share your thoughts with us. Together, we can make the Fabric Adoption Framework even better!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some recent updates on our Fabric Adoption Framework website that I believe will enhance your experience. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, this decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need. You can read more about this change in detail here: [Read more ›](/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our navigation and focusing on the most relevant content, we hope to create a more intuitive experience for you. We want you to spend less time searching and more time engaging with the resources that will help you adopt our framework effectively. The removal of this section is part of our ongoing commitment to improve the clarity and accessibility of our documentation. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this effort; your insights have been invaluable.

As we move forward, we anticipate that these changes will foster a more user-friendly environment, allowing you to navigate our resources with greater ease. We’re always here to listen to your feedback, so please feel free to reach out with any thoughts or suggestions. Together, we can continue to make the Fabric Adoption Framework a great place for everyone involved.
