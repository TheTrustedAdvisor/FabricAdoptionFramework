# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some wonderful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a new License section, which now has its own link in the navigation menu. This addition not only clarifies our licensing terms but also makes it easier for you to find important information about how to use our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We've also worked hard to improve the organization of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we hope to make it simpler for you to navigate through our content and find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have access to the latest methodologies and insights that can guide your journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-9993fe2ef400b1868a1874a379e6fe864b68fd0c.md).

These updates matter because they not only improve the usability of our documentation but also reflect our commitment to supporting you in your Fabric adoption journey. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your input and dedication make all the difference! Together, we’re creating a more accessible and engaging resource for all. (531 commits)

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps to establish the foundation of our documentation, including the introduction of initial content for the adoption framework. This new material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. By streamlining our resources, we aim to create a clearer path for you to access the information that truly matters. This change is a part of our ongoing commitment to ensure that you have the best and most relevant resources at your fingertips. You can read more about the removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their hard work and dedication in bringing these updates to life. As we continue to refine and enhance our documentation, I’m optimistic that these changes will greatly benefit your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Your feedback is always welcome as we strive to make this a valuable resource for everyone.
