By refining our structure, we hope to create a more user-friendly experience for you as you navigate through the resources.

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some significant updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework as smooth and enjoyable as possible. This month, we made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While this may seem like a big change, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and accessible information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to declutter our navigation and enhance your overall experience. This change helps us prioritize the content that truly matters to you, ensuring that you can find what you need without unnecessary distractions. I believe this will lead to a more intuitive journey through our documentation, making it easier for you to adopt and implement the framework effectively.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable in shaping this project, and I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience. Together, we’re creating a resource that truly meets your needs.
