## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework. This foundational work is crucial as it sets the stage for how you can effectively engage with and utilize the framework in your projects. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline your navigation and ensures that you’re only seeing the most pertinent information. I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have helped us refine our documentation and make it more user-friendly.

As we continue to grow and evolve, I expect these updates will not only clarify our framework but also empower you to adopt it more confidently in your endeavors. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable to us, so please keep sharing your thoughts! Together, we’re building something great.
