## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some wonderful updates with you. We’ve taken significant steps to enhance our documentation, particularly with the introduction of the initial content for the adoption framework. This new material provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively adopt and implement our framework, making it easier for you to navigate the journey ahead (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this, we've streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files related to the Fabric Framework. This cleanup not only declutters our site but also ensures that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information. I believe this will create a more intuitive experience for you as you explore our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a user-friendly experience for our community. As we continue to grow and evolve, I’m excited to see how these changes will empower you on your adoption journey. Together, we’re building something special!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, this decision was made with you in mind. We want to streamline your navigation and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without any distractions. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying the structure of our documentation, we hope to create a more intuitive experience for you. This means fewer clicks and a more direct path to the information you need. We believe that this will not only save you time but also help you feel more connected to the content. Your feedback has been invaluable in guiding these changes, and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed their thoughts and insights. 

As we move forward, I’m optimistic that these updates will foster a more engaging and user-friendly environment for all. I encourage you to explore the new layout and let us know how it works for you. Your continued support and involvement make all the difference!
