You can read more about this decision and its implications in detail here: (Read more ›) /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md.

I know that change can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will help us focus on delivering the most relevant and useful content for you. By removing the "What's New" section, we’re encouraging a more integrated approach to updates, allowing you to discover new information seamlessly as you explore the site. I’m excited about the positive impact this will have on your journey with us, making it easier to find what you need without the distraction of a dedicated section for updates. 

A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision. Your feedback is invaluable, and it helps us create a better experience for all. As we continue to evolve, I hope you find our documentation more accessible and engaging. Let's keep moving forward together!
