# What's new

## August 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve synchronized a wealth of new content and documentation, ensuring that you have the most relevant and up-to-date resources at your fingertips. You can dive into the details of these changes in our [latest update](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-08-01&until=2025-08-31) (Read more ›) and see how we've expanded our strategy category visibility to make it easier for you to navigate through our offerings.

One of the highlights of this update is the addition of a License section in our documentation, which provides clarity on how you can use our resources. We’ve also made it easier to find this information by adding a License link directly to our navigation menu (Read more ›). These changes not only improve the structure of our site but also empower you to engage with our materials confidently and responsibly.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts truly make a difference in creating a welcoming and informative space for all users. Together, we’re building a community that supports each other on the journey of Fabric adoption. I can't wait for you to explore these new features! (Read more ›)

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the meaningful changes we've made. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to integrate and utilize our resources effectively. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and implement our framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some of the initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter the navigation, allowing you to focus on the most pertinent information without the distraction of outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). Such adjustments are crucial as they enhance your experience and ensure that you have access to the most current and useful resources.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts make a significant impact on our community, and I’m excited to see how these changes will support you in your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something special.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it served a purpose for a time, we felt that it was no longer the best way to keep you informed about updates. Instead, we’re focusing on integrating changes more seamlessly throughout the documentation, ensuring you can find the latest information without having to navigate through a separate section (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This shift matters because it streamlines your journey through our resources. By embedding updates directly into the relevant sections, we aim to create a more cohesive and intuitive experience. We believe that this will make it easier for you to access the information you need without feeling overwhelmed by separate updates. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision; your insights were invaluable in guiding us towards this new approach (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your interactions with our documentation. We’re committed to continually improving the way we present information, and I hope you find this new structure more helpful and engaging. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your ongoing support (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md).
