## August 2025

August has been a month of refreshing updates for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share what’s new! We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation to better serve you. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a dedicated License section, which is now easily accessible through our navigation menu. This update not only clarifies how you can use our materials but also reflects our commitment to transparency and collaboration in the community (Read more ›).

We also streamlined the documentation structure by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity. This change aims to make your navigation experience smoother, allowing you to find what you need without unnecessary clutter.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes that I believe will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. Most notably, we have removed the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may not be as relevant anymore (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md). 

I understand that change can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I truly believe this will help us focus on delivering the most valuable and pertinent information to you. By simplifying our structure, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience, allowing you to dive straight into the content that matters most to you. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors for their insights and support in this transition, as their feedback has been invaluable in guiding these changes.

As we move forward, I’m excited about the potential impact these adjustments will have on your journey with us. I hope you find it easier to navigate and discover the resources you need to adopt our framework effectively. Together, we are building a more cohesive and user-friendly experience for everyone involved. Thank you for being part of this community!
