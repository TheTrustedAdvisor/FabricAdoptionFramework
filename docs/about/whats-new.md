# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the wonderful changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant updates is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now has its own dedicated link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also makes it easier for you to find important information about how to engage with our resources (Read more ›).

We've also worked on improving the visibility of our strategy category within the documentation. By expanding this section, we hope to make it more intuitive for you to navigate and discover the strategies that can aid your adoption journey. Additionally, we’ve collapsed some sidebar categories for clarity, helping you find what you need more efficiently (Read more ›). 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve you. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience as we continue to grow together.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that provides a clearer understanding of its purpose and benefits. This foundational material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it more accessible and straightforward (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some important structural changes by removing outdated documentation that no longer serves our mission. This streamlining helps to reduce confusion and ensures that you have the most relevant information at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your insights and efforts make a significant difference in shaping our community and resources.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant decision to streamline our documentation by removing the "What's New" section. While it might seem like a big change, we felt it was time to simplify our navigation and focus on delivering the most relevant content directly to you. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By eliminating this section, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. We understand that your time is valuable, and our goal is to ensure that you can easily find the information you need without unnecessary distractions. We hope this change will make it easier for you to engage with our resources and stay focused on your goals. You can read more about the details of this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

A heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights help us shape a better experience for everyone involved.
