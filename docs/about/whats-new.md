We’ve synchronized a wealth of new content from our development repository, ensuring that you have access to the latest insights and strategies for your Fabric adoption journey (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation. This means that finding the information you need will be easier than ever, helping you navigate our resources with confidence (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to enhance your experience, we’ve also made some structural changes. For instance, we collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, which should make it simpler for you to find what you’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). We’ve also added a License section to our documentation and included a link to it in the navigation menu. This addition is important as it helps clarify the terms under which our materials can be used (Read more ›). 

These updates reflect our commitment to creating a user-friendly environment where you can effortlessly explore the resources available to you. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes—your efforts truly make a difference.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework. We’ve introduced a comprehensive overview that sets the stage for understanding how to effectively adopt and integrate our framework into your projects. You can dive into this new content and see how it all comes together in our [overview](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some of the initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining effort helps to clarify the information available and ensures that you’re not wading through outdated materials. I truly believe that these changes will make your journey through our documentation smoother and more intuitive.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section entirely. While it may seem like a big shift, this decision was made with you in mind. We want to streamline your experience and ensure that the most relevant information is easily accessible without clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we aim to enhance your navigation experience and help you find the information you need more quickly. We believe that a cleaner structure will allow you to focus on what truly matters: successfully adopting and implementing our framework in your projects. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improve based on your feedback and needs.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community who contributed to this decision. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable, and they guide us in making our documentation a better resource for all. I’m excited about the positive impact this will have on your journey with us.
