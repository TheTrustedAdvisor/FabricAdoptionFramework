## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was driven by a desire to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By eliminating this section, we hope to enhance your experience and focus on providing more relevant and engaging content throughout the site (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change is important because it allows us to concentrate on the core materials that support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. By removing redundant sections, we can create a more cohesive and intuitive navigation experience, making it simpler for you to discover valuable resources. I am genuinely grateful to our contributors who have worked tirelessly to refine our documentation and ensure it meets your needs (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I anticipate that these updates will lead to a more focused and user-friendly experience for everyone involved. I hope you find the navigation smoother and the content more directly aligned with your goals.
