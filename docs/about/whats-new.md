## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some significant updates that focus on enhancing your experience with our documentation. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This foundational content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to grasp the concepts and apply them in your work (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve streamlined the documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter our resources, ensuring you can find what you need without sifting through outdated information. It’s all about creating a smoother navigation experience for you, and I hope you find it refreshing (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are invaluable in making our documentation more user-friendly and accessible. As we continue to grow, I’m excited to see how these updates will empower you in your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Thank you for being a part of our community!

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This June, we made some significant updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. One of the biggest changes was the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. While it served its purpose, we felt that consolidating our content would provide a clearer and more streamlined experience for you. This decision was made with your needs in mind, aiming to reduce clutter and make it easier for you to find the information you’re looking for. You can read more about this change [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I genuinely believe that these adjustments will enhance your navigation experience on our site. By focusing on a more cohesive structure, we hope to create a space where you can quickly access the resources that matter most to you. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their invaluable feedback, which guided us in making these decisions. Your voices truly shape our documentation, and I am grateful for your continued support.

As we move forward, I’m optimistic that these changes will positively impact how you interact with our documentation. We’re committed to making your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework as smooth and enjoyable as possible. Thank you for being a part of our community!
