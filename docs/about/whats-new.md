In addition to introducing new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our readers. This cleanup helps ensure that you find only the most relevant and useful information without any clutter. I truly believe that these changes will make navigating our resources much more intuitive and enjoyable for you.

## June 2025

Hello everyone! This month, I want to share some significant changes we've made to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This change was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without wading through updates that might not be directly useful to you. If you're curious about the details of this decision, you can read more about it here: [Read more ›](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will lead to a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. By focusing on the core content that truly matters to you, we hope to make navigation smoother and your learning journey more enjoyable. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision; your feedback is invaluable in guiding the evolution of our documentation.

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these adjustments will positively impact your engagement with the framework. I’m always here, eager to hear your thoughts and suggestions, so please don’t hesitate to reach out. Together, we can continue to make this a welcoming and informative space for everyone.
