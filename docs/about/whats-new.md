In addition to refreshing our content, we’ve streamlined our navigation by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, which is a significant step forward in providing you with the resources you need to successfully navigate your adoption journey. You can check out the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to introducing the framework, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our purpose. This streamlining helps us focus on the most relevant and useful information for you. It’s all about making your navigation smoother and ensuring that you have access to the best resources available. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience as you navigate through the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this section has served us well, we felt it was time to streamline the content and improve the overall flow of information. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was not made lightly, but we believe it will allow us to focus on providing you with more relevant and engaging content. By eliminating this section, we can redirect our efforts toward enhancing other areas of the documentation that matter more to you. We hope this will create a more cohesive experience as you explore the resources available to you. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and the ongoing improvements in our documentation.

As we move forward, I’m excited about the impact these changes will have on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’re committed to continuously refining our content and making it as user-friendly as possible. I can't wait to hear your thoughts on these updates!
