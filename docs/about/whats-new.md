## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and accessible documentation experience. We introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a clearer path for you to understand and engage with our offerings (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md). This is a significant step as it not only clarifies our framework but also helps you navigate through the resources more effectively.

In addition to adding new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant to our evolving framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). By streamlining our documentation, we aim to reduce confusion and make it easier for you to find the information you need. It’s all about creating a more user-friendly environment that supports your journey with us.

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable as we continue to refine our documentation and enhance your experience. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes will positively impact your engagement with the framework. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we've made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a small adjustment, it’s a step towards streamlining our content and making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made after careful consideration of how we can best serve you, our community. By consolidating our content, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. It’s all about making sure you can access the most relevant and up-to-date information without any unnecessary distractions. I truly appreciate the feedback from our contributors that helped guide this change, and I’m optimistic about the impact it will have on your journey with us.

As we continue to evolve, your insights remain invaluable. I encourage you to explore the updated structure and let us know how it feels from your perspective. Together, we’re crafting a resource that reflects your needs and aspirations. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!
