Hello, dear readers! I'm thrilled to share some exciting updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps to enrich our documentation by establishing initial content for the adoption framework.

In addition to adding new content, we also made the decision to remove some of the initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining effort helps to clarify our offerings and ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some updates from June that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One notable change this month is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, this decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without unnecessary distractions.

This update matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a more focused and user-friendly navigation experience. By simplifying our documentation structure, we hope to make it easier for you to locate the resources you need, ultimately fostering a smoother journey as you explore the framework. We believe that these kinds of adjustments can significantly impact how you engage with our content, allowing you to dive deeper into the topics that matter most to you.
