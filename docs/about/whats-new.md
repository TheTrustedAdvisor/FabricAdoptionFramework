# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our documentation to ensure you can find what you need more easily. We’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, allowing for a more streamlined navigation experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). This change is all about making your journey through our resources smoother and more intuitive.

In addition, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, along with a link in the navigation menu, which I hope will provide you with clear guidance on usage rights (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). This is an important step towards transparency and ensures that you have all the information you need at your fingertips. We also synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, which means you’ll find the latest insights and practices readily available (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md).

Your feedback and engagement are invaluable as we continue to refine our framework. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that reflect our ongoing commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework more accessible and user-friendly for you. This month, we’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. It’s a significant step forward in providing you with the resources you need to navigate your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-99bbd7955c423e1670f1e1e9f3b50a9a79f6860f.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files related to the Fabric Framework that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline our resources, ensuring that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).
