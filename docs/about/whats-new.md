## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some significant updates from July that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, laying a solid foundation for you to explore and understand its purpose and benefits. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also made some important adjustments by removing outdated documentation files that no longer serve our community's needs. This streamlining means you’ll find it easier to navigate and focus on the most relevant information. We've worked hard to ensure that your journey through our resources is as smooth as possible, and I believe these changes will have a positive impact on how you engage with the framework. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

By simplifying our structure, we hope to make it easier for you to find the most pertinent information without the clutter of redundant updates. We believe this will enhance your overall experience, allowing you to focus on what truly matters to you. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision; your feedback is invaluable and helps us shape a better resource for all.
