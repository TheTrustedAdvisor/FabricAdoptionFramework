# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we've made significant strides in our documentation, including the addition of a new License section and a link to it in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also ensures that you have easy access to important information right at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We've also worked hard to streamline our content. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we've made it easier for you to navigate through our resources and find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, I want to share some significant changes we've made to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. In June, we decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While this might seem like a small change, it reflects our ongoing commitment to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need. By eliminating this section, we hope to reduce clutter and enhance your overall experience as you navigate through our resources. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made with your needs in mind. We recognize that keeping track of updates can sometimes feel overwhelming, and we want to ensure that our documentation remains user-friendly. By focusing on the core content that matters most to you, we anticipate that you'll find it easier to engage with our materials and discover the insights you seek. I genuinely appreciate the feedback from our community that guided this decision, and I believe it will lead to a more cohesive experience for everyone involved.

As we continue to evolve, I encourage you to explore the updated documentation and share your thoughts with us. Your input is invaluable, and together, we can create a space that truly serves your needs. Thank you for being part of this journey with us!
