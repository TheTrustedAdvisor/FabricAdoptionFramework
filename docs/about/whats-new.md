## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July that truly enhance our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we took significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our adoption framework, beginning with the introduction of initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. This new material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

We also made the decision to remove some earlier documentation that was no longer relevant, ensuring that our resources are streamlined and focused on what truly matters for your journey. This cleanup helps to eliminate confusion and allows you to find the information you need without sifting through outdated content.

These updates are not just about tidying up; they reflect our commitment to providing you with the best possible experience as you navigate the adoption framework. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Together, we’re building a resource that truly supports your needs. I’m looking forward to seeing the positive impact these updates will have on your work!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even better. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it might seem like a loss at first glance, we believe this will streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was guided by your feedback and our desire to enhance navigation across the site. By eliminating redundancy, we hope to create a more cohesive experience that allows you to dive straight into the resources that matter most. Our goal is to foster a more intuitive environment where you can focus on learning and applying the framework without unnecessary distractions. Thank you to everyone who contributed their thoughts and insights; your voices are invaluable in shaping our documentation.

As we move forward, we anticipate that these changes will lead to a more engaging and user-friendly experience for all of you. We’re always here to listen and adapt, so please continue to share your thoughts. Together, we can make the Fabric Adoption Framework a place where everyone feels supported and empowered.
