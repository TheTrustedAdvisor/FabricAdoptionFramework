# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a convenient link in the navigation menu. This update not only clarifies the usage rights but also makes it easier for you to find essential information about our framework (Read more ›). 

We also took steps to improve the overall clarity and accessibility of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories, we’ve streamlined navigation, allowing you to find what you need more efficiently (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date resources at your fingertips (Read more ›). These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to making your journey smoother and more informed as you adopt our framework.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts help us create a more user-friendly environment for all. I’m looking forward to seeing how these enhancements impact your experience and support your adoption journey!

## July 2025

July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share the changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our strategies (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and apply our framework in your own projects.

In addition to the new content, we’ve also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, allowing for a more streamlined and focused experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). By decluttering our resources, we hope to make it simpler for you to find the information you need without sifting through outdated materials. 

These updates are not just about changing text; they reflect our commitment to creating a user-friendly environment that truly supports your journey. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in this process, as your contributions make a significant difference.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While it has served its purpose, we felt that it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may no longer be relevant. If you're curious about the details of this change, you can read more about it here: [Read more ›](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This shift is important because it reflects our commitment to providing a clear and concise navigation experience. By removing sections that may have cluttered our documentation, we aim to create a more focused environment for you to explore. I truly believe this will help you find the guidance you need more efficiently, allowing you to engage more deeply with the content that matters most to you.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. It’s your insights that help us grow and improve. Together, we’re making this documentation a better resource for everyone.
