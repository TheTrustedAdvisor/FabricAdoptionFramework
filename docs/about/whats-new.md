## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by introducing initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. You can dive into the details of this new content and its significance in our [overview](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having a clear framework is essential for guiding users through the adoption process. It’s designed to make your journey smoother and more intuitive, ensuring that you have the right resources at your fingertips. We’ve also removed some initial documentation that was no longer relevant, allowing us to streamline the information you see and focus on what truly matters (Read more ›) [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are invaluable, and I’m confident that these updates will have a positive impact on how we all engage with the framework moving forward. Together, we’re building a resource that truly serves our community!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section entirely. While it may seem like a big shift, this decision was made with you in mind. We realized that consolidating our updates into more streamlined content would enhance your experience and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it allows us to focus on delivering content that is more relevant and accessible. By eliminating the separate "What's New" section, we can integrate updates directly into the areas of the documentation where they are most applicable, ensuring you have the latest information right at your fingertips. We believe this will foster a more cohesive reading experience and help you navigate our resources with greater ease.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your input has been invaluable in shaping these changes, and we hope they make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enjoyable. Together, we’re creating a resource that truly serves your needs.
