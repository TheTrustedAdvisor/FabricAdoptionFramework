# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in our documentation, including the addition of a License section and a corresponding link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage rights but also makes it easier for you to find essential information (Read more ›).

We also took a thoughtful approach to our content organization. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we’ve streamlined navigation, allowing you to find what you need more efficiently. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy categories. These updates are designed to ensure you have quick access to the resources that matter most in your adoption journey (Read more ›).

Lastly, I want to express my gratitude to everyone involved in these updates. Your contributions help us create a more user-friendly environment, and I can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your experience. As always, we’re committed to supporting you on your path to successful Fabric adoption. Thank you for being part of our community!

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that have been made to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation.

In addition, we’ve streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to clarify the information available to you, ensuring that you can navigate our resources without any confusion (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience navigating our resources. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made after careful consideration, as we want to streamline the information you receive and help you find the most relevant content more easily. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our documentation, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment for you. This change matters because it allows us to focus on providing you with the most pertinent and updated information without the distraction of a separate section that may not serve your needs as effectively. I genuinely believe this will lead to a more enjoyable and efficient experience as you explore our resources.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision. Your feedback is invaluable, and it drives us to continually improve. I’m excited about the impact these changes will have and can’t wait for you to experience the new layout. Together, we’re building a better resource for all.
