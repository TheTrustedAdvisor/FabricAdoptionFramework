Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates we made to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation in August 2025. This month, we focused on enhancing your experience by syncing new content and refining our navigation. You’ll notice that we’ve added a dedicated License section to the documentation, making it easier for you to understand the terms of use (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to creating a user-friendly environment where you can easily navigate and access the information that supports your fabric adoption journey. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we hope to reduce any overwhelm and help you focus on what truly matters (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

You can find the initial documentation that introduces the framework and its overview, helping you navigate our resources with ease (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea.md). 

We’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that what you see is clear and focused on what matters most (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the “What's New” documentation section. While it served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and improve navigation for you. By decluttering the site, we aim to make it easier for you to find the information you need without unnecessary distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing a user-friendly experience. We want to ensure that you can access relevant content quickly and easily, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—implementing the framework effectively. We believe that by simplifying our structure, we can foster a more intuitive navigation experience for all users (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
