## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by adding initial content that lays the foundation for our adoption framework. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it clearer and more accessible than ever before. You can dive into the details of this initial documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer serves our community's needs. This streamlining helps ensure that you find only the most relevant and helpful information as you navigate through our resources. If you're curious about these changes, you can read more about them [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This June, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without any clutter. While this may seem like a small shift, it reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience and making our documentation more user-friendly. If you're curious about the specifics of this change, you can read more about it here: [Read more ›](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this update matters because it allows us to focus on providing you with the most essential and impactful content, rather than overwhelming you with notifications of every little change. Our goal is to create a seamless navigation experience, and by simplifying our structure, we hope to make it easier for you to find what you need without distraction. We appreciate the community's feedback that guided us in this direction, and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed their thoughts.

As we move forward, I expect this change will positively impact how you interact with our documentation. With a cleaner layout and clearer pathways to the information you seek, I hope you'll feel more empowered to explore and adopt the Fabric Adoption Framework. Your journey with us is important, and we’re excited to continue this adventure together!
