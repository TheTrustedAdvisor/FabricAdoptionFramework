## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that are sure to enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for our adoption framework, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively integrate and utilize our resources. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and implement the framework in your own projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some significant changes by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer align with our current direction. This streamlining is crucial as it helps us present a clearer, more cohesive narrative for our users. By focusing on the most relevant and helpful information, we aim to create a more intuitive experience for everyone engaging with the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for your continued support and dedication. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable as we work to make the Fabric Adoption Framework a truly user-friendly resource. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates will empower you in your adoption journey! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md) (115 commits)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure that I want to share with you. We've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was not made lightly; we believe it will streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need without sifting through updates that may not be relevant to your journey. If you're curious about the details, you can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we aim to enhance your navigation experience. We want to ensure that you can quickly access the content that supports your goals, without unnecessary distractions. It’s all about making your journey with us smoother and more intuitive. I genuinely appreciate the feedback from our community that led us to this decision, and I’m excited about the positive impact it will have on your experience.

As we move forward, I hope you find our documentation even more user-friendly and focused on your needs. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support!
