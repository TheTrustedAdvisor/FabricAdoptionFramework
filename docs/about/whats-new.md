# What's new

## August 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation. One of the key changes is the addition of a License section, which is now easily accessible from the navigation menu. This is important because it clarifies the usage rights and responsibilities associated with our resources, making it easier for you to understand how to engage with our materials (Read more ›).

We’ve also taken steps to improve the overall structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories, we’ve aimed to create a cleaner, more intuitive navigation experience. This change helps you find what you need more quickly, reducing any frustration that comes from sifting through too much information at once (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption and expanded the visibility of our strategy category, ensuring that you have the most relevant information right at your fingertips (Read more ›).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable as we continue to grow and improve. I hope these updates make your journey with us even more enjoyable and productive!

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some wonderful updates with you.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant decision to streamline our documentation by removing the "What's New" section.
