## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve taken significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation. We’ve added initial content that outlines the adoption framework, providing you with a clearer understanding of its purpose and benefits (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This change is crucial because it sets the stage for your journey with the framework, ensuring you have the guidance you need right from the start.

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This cleanup helps to declutter the navigation, making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. I believe these updates will create a more cohesive experience as you explore the resources we offer.

I want to express my heartfelt thanks to everyone involved in these changes. Your contributions make a real difference, and I’m excited about the positive impact these updates will have on our community.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. In an effort to streamline our content and make navigation more intuitive, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made after thoughtful consideration and feedback from our community, as we aim to keep our content focused and relevant. If you’d like to dive deeper into the specifics of this change, you can read about it [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By removing the "What's New" section, we are decluttering our documentation and allowing you to find the information you need more quickly. This change reflects our commitment to providing a user-friendly experience, ensuring that our documentation serves you better. We hope that this will lead to a more seamless journey as you explore and adopt our framework.

I want to take a moment to thank all of you who contributed your thoughts and insights during this process. Your feedback is invaluable and helps us shape a more effective resource for everyone. I’m excited about the positive impact these changes will have on your experience. Let’s continue to grow and improve together!
