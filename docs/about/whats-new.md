# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework! I’m thrilled to share that we’ve made some significant updates to enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the highlights is the addition of a new License section, which you can now easily find in our navigation menu. This change not only clarifies the usage rights associated with our materials but also fosters a greater sense of transparency and trust within our community (Read more ›).

We’ve also streamlined our sidebar categories to improve clarity and navigation throughout the site. By collapsing some categories, we aim to make it easier for you to find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption and expanded the visibility of strategy categories in our documentation. These updates are designed to provide you with a more cohesive and user-friendly experience as you explore our resources (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors who have worked tirelessly to bring these changes to life. Your efforts are what make this community so special, and I’m excited to see how these updates will support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Let’s continue to grow together!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we've made significant strides in enhancing our documentation to better serve you. One of the most notable updates is the introduction of the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md). This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and apply the framework in your own projects.

In addition to this, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This decluttering helps us focus on providing you with the most pertinent information, ensuring that your experience on the site is as smooth as possible (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I truly believe these changes will make a positive impact, allowing you to find what you need without sifting through outdated content.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support during this process. Your feedback is what drives us to improve, and I’m excited to see how these updates will help you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something special!

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without unnecessary clutter (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can be a bit unsettling, but I truly believe this will help us focus more on delivering quality content that speaks directly to your needs. By simplifying our structure, we aim to make it easier for you to access the information you care about most. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who provided feedback and insights that guided this decision.
