# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out a fresh wave of content and structural improvements, including the addition of a License section to our documentation. This change not only clarifies the usage rights but also fosters transparency and trust within our community (Read more ›).

We've also made strides in organizing our navigation menu by adding a direct link to the License section, ensuring that you can easily find essential information. In addition, we collapsed some sidebar categories for clarity, making it simpler for you to navigate through our resources. These adjustments are designed to create a more user-friendly experience, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—adopting and implementing our framework effectively (Read more ›).

Lastly, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable, and together, we're creating a more accessible and engaging documentation experience. I hope you enjoy exploring these changes as much as we enjoyed implementing them!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some heartfelt updates from July 2025 regarding our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month has been particularly significant as we laid down the initial content for the adoption framework itself. We’ve worked hard to create a comprehensive overview that will guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for everyone to understand and implement. You can find this foundational content in our new section dedicated to the Fabric Adoption Framework Overview (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also made the decision to remove some of the initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining helps ensure that you have access to only the most pertinent information, allowing for a smoother navigation experience. I believe this will make it easier for you to find what you need without wading through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our wonderful contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support. Your engagement is what drives us to continuously improve and refine our documentation. I truly believe that these changes will have a positive impact, making our resources more accessible and user-friendly for everyone involved in the adoption journey. Together, we’re building something special!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section from our site. While it may seem like a small detail, this decision was made with you in mind. We realized that consolidating our updates into a more streamlined format would help you find the information you need more efficiently. By eliminating redundancy, we hope to create a smoother navigation experience that allows you to focus on the content that truly matters to you. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This shift is important because it reflects our commitment to enhancing your user experience. We want you to spend less time searching for updates and more time engaging with the resources that support your journey in adopting the Fabric framework. We believe that this change will foster a more cohesive understanding of our documentation and its evolution over time. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who shared their feedback and insights, helping us make this decision.

As we move forward, we anticipate that this streamlined approach will lead to a more engaged readership and a clearer path for newcomers to navigate our resources. Your input is invaluable, and we’re excited to see how these changes positively impact your experience. Together, we’re building a supportive and informative space for all.
