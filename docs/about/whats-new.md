# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some fresh updates from the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We’ve been busy refining our documentation to make it even more accessible and user-friendly. One of the key changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now has its own link in the navigation menu. This is important because it clarifies the terms under which our content can be used, ensuring that you have all the information you need at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We’ve also made strides in improving the overall structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we aim to streamline your navigation experience. This change not only helps you find what you need more quickly but also enhances the overall flow of information throughout the site (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). 

Lastly, we synchronized several important strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the latest insights and guidance on Fabric adoption strategies. This means you can rely on our resources to stay informed and make the best decisions for your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-9993fe2ef400b1868a1874a379e6fe864b68fd0c.md). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts are what make this community thrive. Together, we’re creating a richer experience for all users!

We also took the time to refine our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer necessary. This streamlining helps ensure that you’re not overwhelmed with outdated information, allowing you to focus on the most relevant and helpful resources. It’s all about creating a smoother navigation experience for you as you dive into the framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to improving your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a small adjustment, it’s part of our effort to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find what you need without unnecessary clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to enhance your navigation experience. We understand that clarity and ease of access are paramount when you’re seeking information, and this change is designed to help you focus on the content that truly matters. We believe that a cleaner layout will make it easier for you to engage with the material and find the resources you need more quickly.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable as we strive to create a welcoming and user-friendly environment. We’re excited to see how these changes will positively impact your journey with us!
