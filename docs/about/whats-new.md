Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this may seem like a big shift, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and up-to-date information without the clutter of repetitive updates (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I genuinely believe this change matters because it reflects our commitment to clarity and simplicity. By eliminating this section, we aim to make it easier for you to navigate through our resources and find what you truly need. It’s all about ensuring that your journey with us is as smooth as possible. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community members for their ongoing support and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these updates.

As we move forward, I expect this change to have a positive impact on how you interact with our documentation. With a more focused structure, I hope you’ll find it even easier to engage with the content that truly matters to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
