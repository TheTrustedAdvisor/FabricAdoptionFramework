## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that are sure to enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively embrace and implement our practices. You can explore the details of this new content [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, streamlining our resources for you. This means you’ll find it easier to navigate and locate the information you truly need without the clutter of outdated content. If you're interested in the specifics of what we removed, you can read more about it [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). 

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, concise, and relevant information that supports your journey in adopting our framework. We believe that these updates will not only enhance your understanding but also foster a more engaging experience as you explore the resources available.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that the information you find is as relevant and accessible as possible. You can read more about this change in detail [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that changes like this can feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will allow us to focus on delivering the most important updates and resources directly to you. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to reduce clutter and make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated information. This will ultimately lead to a more user-friendly experience, and I can't wait to see how it impacts your journey with us.

Thank you for your continued support and engagement. Your feedback is invaluable, and it helps us shape a better documentation experience for everyone. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to share them. Let's keep this community thriving together!
