# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us, and I'm thrilled to share some delightful updates that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now provides clarity on how you can use our resources. We've also made it easier to navigate this new section by adding a direct link to the navigation menu (Read more ›). This change is important because it fosters transparency and helps you understand your rights when using our materials.

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our documentation, we've collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity. This should make it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date methodologies (Read more ›). These adjustments reflect our commitment to providing you with a user-friendly experience that supports your adoption journey.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support. Your feedback drives these improvements, and I hope you find these changes helpful as you navigate the framework. Let's keep moving forward together!

## July 2025

Hello dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with our Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding and utilizing our resources effectively. It’s been a labor of love, and I truly hope this new content resonates with you and helps you navigate your adoption journey with confidence. You can check out the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition, we’ve made some structural adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer serves our purpose. This streamlining is essential for keeping our resources relevant and accessible, ensuring that you can find the information you need without sifting through unnecessary content. I appreciate the contributions from our community that have guided these changes, making our documentation clearer and more user-friendly. You can read more about the removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

As we continue to grow and evolve, I’m optimistic that these updates will make your experience smoother and more enriching.
