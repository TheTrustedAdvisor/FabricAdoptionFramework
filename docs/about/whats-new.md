# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the meaningful updates we've made to enhance your experience. One of the significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which not only clarifies usage rights but also builds trust with our community (Read more ›). We've also revamped our navigation menu to include a direct link to this License section, making it easier for you to find important information at a glance (Read more ›). 

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our documentation, we've collapsed sidebar categories for clarity. This change is designed to help you navigate more intuitively, allowing you to focus on what truly matters without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have access to the latest methodologies and insights that can guide your efforts (Read more ›). 

These updates matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with a user-friendly and transparent experience. By making our documentation clearer and more accessible, we hope to empower you on your journey with Fabric. A heartfelt thank you to all our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback, which make these improvements possible. Together, we’re building a stronger framework!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in shaping our documentation by adding initial content that lays the groundwork for the adoption framework. This content is designed to provide you with a clearer understanding of the framework's purpose and how it can support your journey. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

Alongside the new additions, we also took the step to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline our resources, ensuring that you can find the most pertinent information without wading through outdated content. I truly appreciate the community's feedback that guided these changes, making our documentation more user-friendly and focused. You can read about this cleanup [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

As we continue to refine our documentation, I hope these updates make it easier for you to navigate and utilize the Fabric Adoption Framework effectively. Your engagement and insights are invaluable, and I’m grateful for the contributions that help us grow together. Let’s keep this momentum going!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this might feel like a big shift, it’s all about streamlining the information we provide and making it easier for you to find what you need without unnecessary clutter (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment. This change allows us to focus on delivering relevant and timely content directly where it’s most needed, rather than having a separate section that might not always reflect the latest updates. I truly believe this will make your navigation smoother and your learning experience richer (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who has contributed to this effort. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we continue to evolve and improve our documentation. I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your journey with us!
