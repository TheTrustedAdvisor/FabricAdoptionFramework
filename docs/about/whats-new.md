# What's new

## August 2025

August has brought some exciting changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework website that I’m eager to share with you! We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our content and navigation, which I believe will make your experience smoother and more enjoyable. One of the highlights is the addition of a new License section in the documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu, ensuring that you can easily access important licensing information whenever you need it (Read more ›). 

In our ongoing effort to provide clarity and structure, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories to streamline your navigation. This should help you find what you’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, making it easier for you to access the latest insights and guidance on Fabric adoption (Read more ›). 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors for their hard work and dedication in making these updates possible.

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even better. This month, we’ve introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of integrating our solutions into your projects. This foundational content is crucial as it sets the stage for understanding how to effectively adopt and leverage our framework in your work (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps ensure that you can easily find the information you need without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant adjustments to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While this may seem like a big change, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on delivering information that is more relevant and easier to navigate. If you're curious about the specifics of this decision, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with the most useful and engaging content possible. By eliminating redundant sections, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. It’s all about making sure you can find what you need without sifting through unnecessary information. I genuinely believe this will lead to a more enjoyable journey as you explore our resources.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and they guide us in making these important decisions. As we continue to evolve, I’m excited about the positive impact these changes will have on our documentation. Let’s keep moving forward together!
