# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the meaningful updates we've made to enhance your experience. One of the key changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu. This will help clarify the usage rights and responsibilities associated with our resources, making it easier for you to navigate and understand how to engage with our content (Read more ›).

We also took a thoughtful step in reorganizing the sidebar categories for better clarity. By collapsing some of the categories, we aim to streamline your browsing experience, allowing you to find the information you need more efficiently (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption and expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation. These changes are designed to provide you with a clearer path to the resources that matter most to you (Read more ›).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable to us, and they help shape the way we present our information. I hope these updates make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enjoyable and productive!

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the wonderful updates we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding and implementing our guidelines. This content is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it easier for you to navigate the framework and apply it to your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated files that no longer serve our purpose. This cleanup not only declutters our resources but also ensures that you can find the most relevant information without sifting through unnecessary details (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I believe these changes will significantly improve your experience and help you feel more confident as you engage with the framework.

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a resource that truly meets the needs of our community. I’m looking forward to seeing how these enhancements will support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. This month, we made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this may seem like a big change, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make navigation more intuitive for you. By consolidating information in a more cohesive manner, we hope to create a smoother journey through our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it allows us to focus on delivering the most relevant and useful information without the clutter of redundant sections. We’re committed to ensuring that you can find what you need quickly and efficiently, and this update is a step toward that goal. Thank you to everyone who contributed their thoughts and feedback; your input is invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve our community (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, we expect that this streamlined approach will not only improve your navigation experience but will also encourage more engagement with our content. We’re excited about the possibilities this opens up for clearer communication and more focused updates in the future. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md). (19 commits)
