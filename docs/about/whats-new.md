# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu. This is a vital step in ensuring transparency and clarity about how our content can be used (Read more ›). 

We’ve also made strides in improving the organization of our content. By collapsing sidebar categories, we aimed to provide a cleaner, more navigable experience for you. This should make it easier to find the information you're looking for without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, which means you now have access to the most up-to-date resources to support your adoption journey (Read more ›). 

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are what help us grow and improve. I hope these changes make your navigation smoother and your learning experience richer. Here’s to a fantastic month ahead!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by establishing the initial content for the adoption framework itself. This foundational work is crucial as it lays the groundwork for a more structured approach to adopting our framework, making it easier for you to navigate and understand the resources available to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some of the initial files that were no longer necessary. This cleanup helps to clarify our offerings and ensures that you can find the most relevant information without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their hard work and dedication in bringing these updates to life.

As we move forward, I anticipate that these changes will not only improve your navigation experience but also empower you to adopt the framework with greater confidence. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable to us, and I can't wait to see how these enhancements will support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section entirely. While it might seem like a small adjustment, this decision was made with your experience in mind. We believe that by streamlining our content, we can help you find the information you need more quickly and efficiently (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md). 

The rationale behind this change is to enhance the overall navigation of our site. By eliminating this section, we aim to create a more cohesive flow of information that allows you to focus on the content that truly matters. We hope this will lead to a more intuitive user experience, making it easier for you to engage with our resources and find the guidance you need as you adopt our framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt gratitude to our contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these changes. Your insights drive us to continuously improve, and I’m excited to see how these updates will positively impact your journey with us (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md).
