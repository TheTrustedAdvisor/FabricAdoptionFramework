## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This change reflects our commitment to streamline the information you receive, focusing on the most relevant content without redundancy. You can read more about this decision in detail here: [Remove "What's New" Documentation Section](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating this section, we aim to reduce clutter and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. It’s all about creating a more user-friendly environment where you can navigate seamlessly and access the resources you need without unnecessary distractions. I genuinely hope this change will make your journey through our documentation smoother and more enjoyable.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which guide us in making these improvements. Your input is invaluable, and I look forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.
