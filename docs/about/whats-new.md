## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by introducing initial content for the adoption framework itself. This foundational material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and implement the framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our purpose. This cleanup helps ensure that you can focus on the most relevant and useful information without the distraction of unnecessary clutter (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I truly believe these changes will create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience for everyone engaging with our framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation that I want to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While this section has served us well, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make navigation easier for you. By focusing on the most relevant and impactful information, we hope to enhance your experience as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision matters because we want to ensure that you can find what you need without sifting through unnecessary details. By simplifying our structure, we aim to create a more intuitive and user-friendly environment. I believe this will make it easier for you to engage with our content and discover the insights that truly matter to your journey with the framework.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and the changes that followed. Your input is invaluable, and it helps us create a space that truly serves our community. I’m excited about the positive impact these adjustments will have on your experience. Together, we’re making strides toward a more accessible and enjoyable documentation journey!
