## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! This August, I’m thrilled to share some exciting updates that have taken place on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. We’ve made significant strides in enhancing the structure and clarity of our documentation. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a License section, which not only helps clarify usage rights but also reflects our commitment to transparency and collaboration in our community (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve streamlined our navigation by adding a License link, making it easier for you to find important information at a glance (Read more ›). 

In our ongoing effort to improve your experience, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity, ensuring that you can navigate our content with ease (Read more ›). This is all part of our goal to create a more user-friendly environment where you can focus on what truly matters: adopting and implementing Fabric effectively.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by adding initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter our resources and ensures that you have access to only the most pertinent information. I truly believe that these changes will make navigating our framework much easier and more intuitive for you. For more on this, check out the updates on the removal of outdated documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable in making our documentation clearer and more accessible. I hope you find these changes helpful and that they empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something great!
