# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made some significant strides in improving our documentation. We added a new License section that provides clarity on usage rights and responsibilities, making it easier for you to navigate our content (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve revamped our navigation menu to include a direct link to this License section, ensuring you can find what you need without any hassle (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our resources, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity. This change will help you focus on the content that matters most to you without feeling overwhelmed by too many options (Read more ›). Furthermore, we synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy categories, making it simpler for you to access the information that supports your adoption journey (Read more ›).

These updates are all about making your experience smoother and more intuitive. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support in making these changes possible. Your feedback truly shapes our documentation, and I can't wait to see how these improvements impact your work with the Fabric Adoption Framework!

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the meaningful changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively integrate and utilize our resources. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and implement best practices in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files related to the Fabric Framework. This cleanup not only declutters our site but also ensures that you’re accessing the most relevant and up-to-date information. We believe that a clearer navigation experience will empower you to find what you need quickly and efficiently (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community for your contributions and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these updates. We’re optimistic that these changes will foster a more engaging and user-friendly environment for all of you as you embark on your adoption journey with us. Together, we’re building something great!

Why does this matter? By consolidating our documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive experience for you as you navigate through our resources. We want to ensure that your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework is as smooth and intuitive as possible. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improving our documentation based on your feedback and needs. 

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and community members who have been part of this journey. Your insights and suggestions have been invaluable in shaping our documentation.
