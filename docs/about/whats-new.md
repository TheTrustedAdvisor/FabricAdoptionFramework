August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful updates we've made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a new License section to our documentation, which now provides clarity on usage and contributions (Read more ›). We also made it easier to navigate by adding a direct link to this License in the navigation menu, ensuring you can find important information quickly (Read more ›). 

In our ongoing effort to streamline the content, we collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, which should help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy category within the documentation.

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July. This month, we’ve made significant strides in shaping the Fabric Adoption Framework, starting with the introduction of initial content that lays the foundation for our documentation. This is a big step forward, as it gives you a clearer understanding of what the framework is all about and how it can support your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

We also took the opportunity to streamline our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter the navigation and ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without any distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! June has been a month of reflection and adjustment for the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. One of the most significant changes we made was the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision stemmed from a desire to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By consolidating our updates into more integrated sections, we aim to enhance your overall experience and ensure that you can navigate our resources with greater ease (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change is important because it reflects our commitment to clarity and usability. We want to make sure that every piece of information you encounter is relevant and valuable, without unnecessary clutter. By focusing on a more cohesive structure, we hope to foster a more engaging and supportive environment for your journey with us (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
