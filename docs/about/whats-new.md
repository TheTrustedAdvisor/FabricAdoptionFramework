## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement and utilize our resources. You can dive into the details of this initial documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also made some important adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our purpose. This streamlining is essential as it helps to clarify our messaging and ensures that you have access to the most relevant information. You can read more about these changes [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we’ve made a significant change that I want to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section from our website. This decision was not taken lightly, but we believe it will streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the information you need without any clutter. You can read more about this change in detail [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to enhance your navigation experience. We want you to focus on the content that truly matters to you, rather than sifting through updates that may not be relevant. This change reflects our commitment to creating a user-friendly environment where you can easily access the resources you need to adopt and implement our framework effectively.

I want to thank our contributors and the community for their insights and feedback, which have guided us in making this decision. As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we can continue to build a supportive and engaging space for everyone involved.
