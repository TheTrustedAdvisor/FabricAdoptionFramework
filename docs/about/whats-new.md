## August 2025

August has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I can’t wait to share the updates with you! We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation to make it more user-friendly and accessible. One of the highlights is the addition of a new License section, which not only clarifies the usage rights but also adds a direct link in our navigation menu for easy access (Read more ›). This change reflects our commitment to transparency and helps you understand how you can engage with our content.

We also took a closer look at our strategy documents, synchronizing and expanding their visibility within the documentation. This means you can now find essential strategies for Fabric adoption more easily, which is crucial for anyone looking to implement our framework effectively (Read more ›).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small change, this move helps streamline our content and ensures that you can find the most relevant information without any clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. We believe that when information is clear and easily accessible, it empowers you to make the most of the resources available. Our hope is that this will lead to a more engaging and productive journey as you explore the framework. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision and to our community for your ongoing support.

As we continue to evolve, your feedback remains invaluable. We’re excited about the positive impact these changes will have on your experience, and we look forward to hearing how they resonate with you. Thank you for being a part of our journey!
