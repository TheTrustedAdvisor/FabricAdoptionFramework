# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some delightful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our documentation to make it more user-friendly. For instance, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, allowing you to navigate more easily through the content (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

We also took the opportunity to sync and update our published strategy methodology documents, which means you now have access to the latest insights and approaches for Fabric adoption (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md). Plus, we added a License section to our documentation and made sure it’s easy to find in the navigation menu (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md) — a small but important step toward transparency and accessibility.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some wonderful updates with you. We’ve added initial content that lays the groundwork for our adoption framework, which I believe will be invaluable for anyone looking to navigate this space effectively. This new section not only provides a comprehensive overview but also sets the tone for what’s to come. You can dive into the details of this addition [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining helps us focus on delivering clear, concise, and useful information. I truly believe that these changes will enhance your experience, making it easier to find the information you need without the clutter of outdated resources. If you’re curious about what was removed, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and collaboration. Your insights and feedback are what help us grow and improve. I’m excited about the impact these changes will have, and I can’t wait to see how they assist you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Thank you for being a part of this community!
