# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we focused on streamlining our content and making it more accessible. Notably, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, which you can now find in the navigation menu. This addition not only clarifies our usage policies but also ensures that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips (Read more ›).

We’ve also made significant strides in organizing our content. By collapsing sidebar categories, we’ve improved clarity and navigation, making it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, which means you can now explore the latest insights and strategies for Fabric adoption more seamlessly than ever (Read more ›). 

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with a user-friendly experience that supports your journey in adopting Fabric. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community members who made these updates possible. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable to us. I’m looking forward to seeing how these enhancements impact your work!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some significant updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by introducing initial content that will serve as a guiding light for our community. You can explore the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). We’ve also established a comprehensive overview of the framework, which I hope will help you navigate our resources more easily (Read more ›).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining effort is all about making sure you have access to the most pertinent information without the clutter. You can read about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md) and [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md). I genuinely believe these changes will create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience as you engage with our framework.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this month’s updates. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a resource that truly meets the needs of our community.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we have decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This change was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may not be relevant to your current needs. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we hope to create a more focused and user-friendly experience. With less clutter, you can navigate our resources with greater ease and find the guidance you seek more quickly. This is all part of our commitment to continuously improve how we serve you, our wonderful community. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this change and shared their feedback along the way.

As we move forward, I’m excited about the positive impact these adjustments will have on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’re dedicated to ensuring that our documentation is not just informative but also welcoming and easy to use. I truly appreciate your continued support and engagement as we strive to make this space better for all of us.
