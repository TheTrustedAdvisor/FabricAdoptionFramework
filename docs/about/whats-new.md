# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, making it easier for you to understand the terms under which our materials can be used (Read more ›). We’ve also included a License link in the navigation menu, ensuring that this important information is just a click away (Read more ›). These changes reflect our commitment to transparency and accessibility, helping you navigate our resources with confidence.

In addition to these updates, we’ve worked hard to synchronize our published strategy methodology documents and expand the visibility of our strategy category within the documentation (Read more ›). This means you’ll find it easier to access and understand the strategies that can guide your adoption journey. We believe that by streamlining the content and structure, you’ll have a more intuitive experience that supports your goals.

Lastly, we’ve made some adjustments to the sidebar categories for clarity, which should help you find what you need without any hassle (Read more ›). I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable as we continue to evolve and improve our documentation. Together, we’re making strides toward a more user-friendly experience! (531 commits)

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a big leap forward by establishing the initial content for our adoption framework. This foundational material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

We also took the time to streamline our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This decluttering effort helps ensure that you can find the most pertinent information without wading through outdated content. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more intuitive. If you’re curious about the specifics of what was removed, you can read more [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are what make this community thrive, and I truly appreciate your dedication. I hope you find these updates helpful as you navigate the framework. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, I want to share some significant updates that have taken place on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. We made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This change was not made lightly, but we believe it will streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need. By focusing on more integrated updates throughout our documentation, we hope to create a more cohesive narrative that reflects the evolution of our framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, we want to ensure that your journey through our documentation is as smooth and intuitive as possible. By consolidating updates into relevant sections, we aim to enhance clarity and reduce any confusion that may arise from having a separate "What's New" section. We believe this will empower you to engage more deeply with the content and feel more connected to the ongoing development of the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their support and feedback, which have been invaluable in guiding these changes. Your insights help us create a better experience for everyone, and I’m excited to see how these adjustments will positively impact your use of the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something truly special (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md).
