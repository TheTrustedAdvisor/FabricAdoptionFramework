# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the meaningful changes we've made to enhance your experience! One of the highlights is the addition of a dedicated License section in our documentation, along with a new License link in the navigation menu. This is important because it provides clarity on how you can use our resources, ensuring that you have all the information you need at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by establishing the initial content for our adoption framework. This foundational work is not just about filling pages; it’s about creating a resource that will guide you through the adoption process in a clear and accessible way. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also took the necessary step of removing outdated initial documentation on the Fabric Framework. This cleanup helps streamline our resources, ensuring that you have the most relevant and helpful information at your fingertips. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more intuitive, and I believe these changes will have a positive impact on how you navigate our documentation.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. It’s your insights that help us create a better experience for everyone.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes that I believe will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a big shift, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made with your needs in mind. By simplifying our navigation and reducing redundancy, we aim to create a smoother journey for you as you explore our resources. It’s all about making it easier for you to find what you’re looking for without the clutter. I truly appreciate the feedback from our community that led us to this point, and I hope you’ll find the updated structure more intuitive and user-friendly.

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience on the site. I encourage you to dive in and explore the new layout. Thank you for being a part of our journey, and for your continued support and engagement!
