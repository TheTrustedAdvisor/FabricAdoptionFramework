# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the changes we've made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant updates is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which not only clarifies how you can use our resources but also adds a License link to the navigation menu for easy access (Read more ›). This change is all about transparency and ensuring that you have the information you need right at your fingertips.

We’ve also worked hard to improve the overall structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we've made it easier for you to navigate and find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have the latest methodologies and insights at your disposal (Read more ›). These updates are designed to streamline your journey with us and make it more intuitive.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable, and it drives us to continually improve. I hope these changes make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more rewarding.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, providing you with a solid foundation to understand how to effectively implement and utilize our resources. This is a significant step forward, as it not only gives you the necessary information but also helps clarify our framework's purpose and goals (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline your navigation and ensures that you’re accessing the most up-to-date and useful information. By focusing on the content that truly matters, we’re making it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed to these changes. Your feedback and support are invaluable, and I’m hopeful that these updates will make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more rewarding. Together, we’re building a resource that truly serves your needs! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience with our content. We've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made after careful consideration, as we felt that the information was becoming repetitive and could be better integrated into our main content. By streamlining our documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience for you. If you're curious about the details of this change, you can read more [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can sometimes be a bit unsettling, but I truly believe this will allow us to focus on delivering the most relevant and valuable information to you in a more engaging way. We want to ensure that you can easily find what you need without sifting through sections that may no longer serve you. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and for your continued support as we evolve our documentation to better meet your needs.

As we move forward, I anticipate that this change will not only simplify navigation but also encourage a more fluid exploration of our resources. I’m excited to see how this will improve your journey with us!
