## July 2025

July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share the changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve added initial content that lays the groundwork for the adoption framework, providing you with a clearer understanding of its purpose and how it can benefit your projects. This foundational content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to integrate our framework into your work (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

In addition to the new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated files that no longer serve our community's needs. This cleanup not only declutters our resources but also helps you find the information you need more efficiently. By focusing on relevant and up-to-date material, we aim to create a more user-friendly environment for everyone (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input has been invaluable in shaping this framework, and I’m eager to see how these changes will empower you in your adoption journey. Together, we are building something truly special.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While it served its purpose, we felt that it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may not be as relevant anymore. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision matters because we want to ensure that our documentation feels cohesive and user-friendly. By removing the "What's New" section, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. This will help you focus on the essential content without distractions, allowing for a smoother journey through our resources. I truly appreciate the feedback from our community that guided us to this decision, and I hope it makes your exploration of the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enjoyable.

As we move forward, I expect this change to foster a more engaging and efficient experience for all of you. Thank you for being a part of our journey and for your continued support. Together, we can keep improving and adapting to your needs!
