# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content and improving navigation. You’ll notice that we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, making it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›) and we’ve also expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation, ensuring that essential resources are front and center for you (Read more ›).

In addition to these structural improvements, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, which can now be found in the navigation menu. This is an important step towards transparency and helps clarify how you can use our resources (Read more ›). We’ve also synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, bringing you the latest insights and practices for successful Fabric adoption (Read more ›). Each of these changes is designed with you in mind, aiming to create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable to us. We’re committed to continually improving our documentation to better serve our community, and I can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some meaningful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and comprehensive adoption framework, which includes the introduction of initial content that will guide you through the adoption process (Read more ›) and an overview that clearly outlines what you can expect as you engage with our framework (Read more ›). 

These changes matter because they provide a clearer path for you, our valued community, as you navigate the complexities of adopting our framework. By establishing foundational content, we aim to make your journey smoother and more intuitive. We’ve also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that you have access to only the most pertinent information (Read more ›). 

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your insights and efforts are what make our documentation a living resource that evolves with our community's needs. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes impact your experience and hope you find the new content helpful as you embark on your adoption journey. Together, we’re creating something special!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this might seem like a big shift, the intention behind it is to streamline your experience. We believe that by integrating updates directly into the relevant sections of our documentation, you’ll find it easier to access the information you need without having to navigate through separate announcements (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to enhancing your user experience. By consolidating information, we aim to create a more cohesive and intuitive navigation experience. We hope this will help you find what you’re looking for more quickly and efficiently, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—adopting and implementing our framework effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which have been invaluable in guiding these decisions. We’re looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your journey with us. As always, we appreciate your engagement and are here to support you every step of the way.
