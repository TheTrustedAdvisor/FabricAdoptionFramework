## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. This month, we made a significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it served its purpose, we believe this change will streamline our content and make it easier for you to navigate the information that truly matters to your journey. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. This change reflects our commitment to ensuring that you can find what you need without unnecessary distractions. We hope this will encourage you to explore our resources more freely and engage with the content that supports your adoption journey. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and to our community for your ongoing feedback and support!

As we move forward, we anticipate that this streamlined approach will not only enhance your experience but also allow us to focus on delivering more valuable content that aligns with your needs. We’re excited about the path ahead and can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your journey with us.
