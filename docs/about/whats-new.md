# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even smoother. We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, ensuring you have the most relevant and accessible information at your fingertips. One of the highlights this month is the addition of a new License section, which you can now easily find in our navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage terms but also fosters a sense of transparency and trust within our community (Read more ›).

We’ve also worked on refining the structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories, we aimed to create a cleaner, more intuitive navigation experience. This should help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed by options (Read more ›). Additionally, we synchronized our strategy methodology documents, ensuring that the latest insights and strategies are readily available for you to explore and implement (Read more ›). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all contributors and community members who have worked tirelessly to bring these changes to life. Your dedication is what makes this project thrive, and I can’t wait to see how these updates will impact your experience.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some meaningful updates with you. We’ve taken significant steps to enhance our documentation, particularly by introducing the initial content for the adoption framework. This foundational material aims to provide you with a clearer understanding of how to effectively adopt and implement our framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

Why is this important? Well, having a solid starting point will help you navigate the complexities of adoption with confidence. We’ve also established an overview section that outlines the framework's key components, making it easier for you to find what you need and get started (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). This clarity not only empowers you but also fosters a stronger community as we all work together towards successful implementations.

In addition to adding new content, we’ve streamlined the documentation by removing outdated files that no longer serve our purpose. This cleanup ensures that you can focus on the most relevant and useful information without distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section from our website. While this may seem like a small adjustment, it reflects our commitment to streamlining your experience and ensuring that the content you access is always relevant and up-to-date. By consolidating our information, we aim to make navigation more intuitive and help you find what you need without any distractions. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change matters because it allows us to focus on delivering high-quality, user-friendly documentation that truly serves your needs. Our goal is to create a seamless experience for you, whether you’re just starting with the Fabric Adoption Framework or diving deeper into its capabilities. We hope that by simplifying our structure, you'll find it easier to engage with the content and discover the insights you're looking for. 

A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who has provided feedback and contributed to this evolution. Your voices guide us, and we’re excited to see how these changes enhance your journey with us. Let's continue to grow together!
