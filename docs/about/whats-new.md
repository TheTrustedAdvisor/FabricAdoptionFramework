# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve refreshed our content and structure to make navigation smoother and more intuitive. For instance, we've added a new License section to our documentation, which you can now easily find in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our licensing terms but also ensures that you have quick access to important information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We've also made strides in organizing our documentation by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity. This should help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed by options. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most current and relevant strategies at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md). I truly believe these changes will make your journey through our documentation more enjoyable and productive.

A big thank you to our contributors and the community for your continued support and feedback. Your insights help us create a better experience for everyone.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of integrating Fabric into your projects. You can explore the initial documentation and framework overview that we’ve put together, and I truly believe these resources will empower you on your journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our purpose. This cleanup not only declutters our site but also ensures that you have access to the most relevant and useful information. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors who have worked diligently to bring these changes to life. Your efforts are invaluable in making our documentation more user-friendly and effective (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

As we continue to refine our content and structure, I’m hopeful that these updates will make navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework a more enjoyable and enriching experience for you. Your feedback is always welcome, and I can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your projects. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I hope this message finds you well. This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we've removed the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that the information you find is as relevant and accessible as possible (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md). 

Why does this matter? By simplifying our navigation, we aim to make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may not be pertinent to your current needs. This change is all about focusing on what truly matters to you and ensuring that our documentation serves you better. I truly appreciate the community's feedback that led us to this decision, and I hope you feel the positive impact of this shift as you explore our resources.

As we continue to refine our documentation, I encourage you to share your thoughts and experiences. Your input is invaluable in helping us create a user-friendly environment that meets your needs. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!
