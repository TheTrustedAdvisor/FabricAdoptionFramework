This month, we've added a new License section to our documentation, making it clearer for everyone how they can use our resources responsibly (Read more ›). Additionally, we've made it easier to navigate by adding a direct link to the License in our navigation menu. These changes are all about ensuring that you have the information you need at your fingertips, fostering a more user-friendly environment.

We also took a step to improve clarity in our documentation structure by collapsing sidebar categories. This should help you find what you're looking for without feeling overwhelmed by too many options (Read more ›). Furthermore, we synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy categories. This means you can now access and understand our strategies for Fabric adoption more easily, which I hope will empower you in your journey (Read more ›).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This change was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on the core documentation, we hope to enhance your experience and ensure that you can navigate our resources with greater ease. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision stems from our ongoing commitment to improve clarity and accessibility in our documentation. We believe that by simplifying our structure, we can help you spend less time searching for updates and more time engaging with the content that supports your journey. We expect this will lead to a more intuitive experience for everyone involved, allowing you to dive deeper into the resources we provide without unnecessary distractions. 

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and community members who have provided feedback and insights that guided us in this direction.
