# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation. One of the highlights is the addition of a new License section, which not only clarifies the usage rights but also has its own link in the navigation menu for easy access (Read more ›). This change is important because it ensures transparency and helps you understand how to use our resources responsibly.

We’ve also been working on streamlining our content. You might notice that we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, making it easier to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation (Read more ›). These updates are designed to create a smoother navigation experience, allowing you to focus more on your journey with Fabric adoption.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community members who have been instrumental in these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable to us. I hope you find these changes helpful and that they empower you in your endeavors!

## July 2025

July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share the updates with you! We’ve taken significant steps by introducing initial content for the adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for a more structured approach to utilizing our resources effectively. This content not only provides clarity but also serves as a guiding light for those looking to navigate the framework with confidence (Read more ›).

In addition to adding valuable content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer aligned with our vision. This streamlining helps to ensure that you can focus on the most relevant and useful information without the clutter of outdated resources (Read more ›). By refining our documentation, we hope to enhance your experience and make it easier for you to find what you need when you need it.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are what make this community thrive, and I truly believe that these updates will have a positive impact on our readers as they embark on their journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I’m excited to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While it was a valuable resource, we felt that consolidating our updates into more streamlined content would enhance your experience and make it easier to find the information you need. This change is part of our ongoing effort to ensure that our documentation remains clear and user-friendly. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe that this shift will help us focus on delivering relevant content without the clutter of multiple sections. By simplifying our navigation, we hope to create a smoother journey for you as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and provided feedback; your insights are invaluable to us. 

As we move forward, I expect that these changes will make it easier for you to stay engaged and informed about our evolving framework. We’re committed to continuously improving your experience, and I can’t wait to see how these updates will enhance your journey with us.
