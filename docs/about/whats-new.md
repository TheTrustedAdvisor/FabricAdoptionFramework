In our ongoing commitment to clarity, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for better organization. This adjustment is designed to help you navigate our resources more intuitively, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—your journey in adopting Fabric. Additionally, we synchronized various strategy methodology documents and expanded their visibility, ensuring that you have the most relevant strategies at your fingertips (Read more ›).

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

This addition is crucial as it provides you with the guidance needed to navigate the framework confidently.

In our efforts to streamline the information available, we also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This cleanup not only simplifies your journey through our resources but also ensures that you are accessing the most pertinent and up-to-date information. We believe that a clearer structure will help you find what you need more easily, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—your adoption journey.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While it has served its purpose, we felt that it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through outdated updates. If you're curious about the details of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision is important because it reflects our commitment to keeping our documentation relevant and user-friendly. By focusing on the core content that truly matters, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. Our aim is to ensure that you can easily access the guidance and resources you need, without any unnecessary clutter. I genuinely believe that this will lead to a more efficient and enjoyable journey through our documentation.

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and community members who have provided feedback and insights that guided us in making these changes. Your voices matter, and they help us create a better experience for everyone. I’m excited for you to explore the updated documentation and see how these changes can benefit your work!
