## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While it served us well, we believe this change will streamline your experience and help you find the information you need more efficiently. You can read more about this decision in detail [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment for you. We understand that navigating through information can sometimes feel overwhelming, and we hope this adjustment will allow you to focus on the content that truly matters to you. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more enjoyable.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and they help us shape a better experience for everyone involved. Together, we’re creating something special, and I can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your use of the Fabric Adoption Framework.
