## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps in shaping our documentation by introducing initial content specifically for the adoption framework. This new material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it clearer and more accessible than ever before (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

In addition to adding fresh content, we also refined our structure by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our community's needs. This cleanup not only streamlines navigation but also helps you find the information you need without unnecessary distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant updates to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. One of the most notable changes is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made after careful consideration, as we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant information without redundancy. You can read more about this change [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter to you? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to enhance your experience as you navigate through our resources. We believe that a cleaner, more straightforward layout will help you find the information you need more quickly and efficiently. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improving our documentation based on your feedback and needs.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community who contributed to this decision. Your voices are invaluable, and they guide us in creating a better experience for all. We’re hopeful that these updates will make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even smoother and more enjoyable. As always, we appreciate your support and engagement.
