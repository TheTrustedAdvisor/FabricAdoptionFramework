# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation, ensuring that you can find what you need more easily and intuitively. For instance, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, along with a convenient link in the navigation menu, making it clearer for everyone to understand the terms under which our materials are shared (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories, which should help streamline your navigation experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

These enhancements are all about making your journey smoother and more enjoyable as you explore our resources. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community for their invaluable input and support in bringing these changes to life. Together, we’re building a more accessible and user-friendly framework for everyone! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-29aca670872315962827412318cbc8e797896e58.md)

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we've made significant strides in enhancing our documentation to better serve you. We’ve introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices in your projects (Read more ›). This new content is designed to be user-friendly, providing clear guidance that will help you navigate the adoption process with confidence.

In addition to adding new materials, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer align with our current framework (Read more ›). This cleanup not only helps declutter our resources but also ensures that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information. I believe this will make your experience smoother and more intuitive as you explore the framework.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support throughout this process. Your engagement is what drives us to improve and evolve, and I can’t wait to see how these changes impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something truly special. (Read more ›) [115 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-07-01&until=2025-07-31)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant changes we’ve made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this month. As part of our ongoing effort to streamline your experience, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This decision came from your feedback, and we believe it will help simplify the navigation and make finding the information you need even easier (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md). 

This change matters because it allows us to focus on enhancing the content that truly supports your journey with the framework. By decluttering our documentation, we hope to create a more intuitive experience for you, making it simpler to locate the resources and guidance you need. We’re always listening to your insights, and this adjustment reflects our commitment to improving your experience with us.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your voices are invaluable in shaping our documentation, and I’m excited to see how these changes positively impact your engagement with the framework. Together, we’re creating a resource that truly serves you!
