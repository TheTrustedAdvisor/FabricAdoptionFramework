# What's new

## August 2025

Hello everyone! August has been a bustling month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the changes we've made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant updates is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now includes a direct link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies the terms under which our content is shared but also ensures that you have easy access to this important information (Read more ›).

We've also worked hard to streamline our documentation structure. By collapsing sidebar categories, we've made it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed. This clarity is vital as we continue to expand our strategy category visibility and synchronize our published strategies for Fabric adoption. I believe these updates will make navigating our resources a more pleasant and efficient experience for you (Read more ›).

Lastly, I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights help us shape the framework into a more user-friendly resource. I hope you find these updates beneficial, and as always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts!

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we’ve laid down the groundwork for something truly special. We’ve added initial content to our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of integrating our fabric into your projects. This new content not only provides clarity but also aims to enhance your experience as you navigate through the adoption process (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having a structured framework is essential for anyone looking to adopt our technology. It simplifies the journey, making it more approachable and less daunting. We believe that by establishing this initial documentation, we are empowering you to make informed decisions and feel more confident in your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

In addition to this, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and useful information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant shift in our documentation by removing the "What's New" section entirely. This decision stemmed from a desire to streamline our content and enhance your navigation experience. By consolidating updates into more relevant areas, we hope to provide you with a clearer and more focused journey through our materials. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change matters because it reflects our commitment to making your experience as seamless as possible. We want to ensure that you can easily find the information you need without sifting through a separate section that may not always be relevant. By integrating updates directly into the content, we aim to keep everything cohesive and user-friendly. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision and to the community for your ongoing support and feedback.

As we move forward, I anticipate that this adjustment will make it easier for you to stay informed about important changes and improvements in our framework. Your engagement and insights are invaluable to us, and we’re excited to continue evolving together. If you're curious about the specifics of this transition, feel free to check out more details [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md). Together, let’s keep building a resource that truly serves you well! (19 commits)
