## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that are sure to enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content and improving navigation. For instance, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity, making it easier for you to find exactly what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we've added a License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md). 

These changes matter because they create a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. By streamlining our documentation structure and ensuring that essential information is readily available, we aim to empower you on your journey toward successful Fabric adoption. We’ve also synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, providing you with the most current and relevant insights (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md).

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and user-friendly documentation experience. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which provides clear guidance and resources to help you navigate your journey with us. You can find this new content in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md) (Read more ›).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also made some thoughtful adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our purpose. This streamlining is meant to declutter your experience and ensure that the information you access is relevant and up-to-date. I truly believe these changes will make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through unnecessary details. If you're curious about the specific removals, you can read more about them [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md) (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input has been invaluable in shaping these updates, and I’m excited about the positive impact these changes will have on our documentation. Together, we’re building a more accessible and engaging resource for everyone involved in the Fabric Adoption Framework. Let’s keep moving forward!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made some significant changes to our documentation that I’m excited to share with you. In a move to streamline our content, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made with the intention of enhancing your experience by consolidating information in a more organized manner. You can read more about this update in the detailed changes we’ve documented (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to create a more cohesive narrative throughout our documentation. This change allows us to focus on delivering relevant and up-to-date information directly within the sections where it matters most. We believe this will help you find what you need more quickly and efficiently, making your journey through our resources smoother and more enjoyable.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their feedback and support in this process. Your voices help shape our documentation, and we’re committed to making it the best it can be for you. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience as we continue to grow together.
