## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While it served us well for a time, we felt it was becoming redundant and not as useful as we hoped. This change allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. If you're curious about the details, you can read more about this decision [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through sections that may no longer serve a purpose. We want to ensure that your journey through our resources is as smooth and enjoyable as possible. I genuinely appreciate the feedback from our community that guided us to this decision, and I hope you feel the positive impact of these changes as you navigate our site.

As we move forward, I expect that this refinement will lead to a more cohesive and user-friendly experience for everyone. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support. Together, we’re building something great! (Read more ›) [19 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30)
