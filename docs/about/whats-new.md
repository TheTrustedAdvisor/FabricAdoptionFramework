## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in shaping our documentation to better serve you. We introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. You can dive into this new material [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

Alongside this, we also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files related to the Fabric Framework. This cleanup not only declutters our site but also ensures that you can find the most relevant and up-to-date information without any confusion.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, it reflects our commitment to streamline your experience and ensure that you can easily find the most relevant information without any clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made after careful consideration of how you engage with our content. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. We believe this will help you focus on the essential aspects of the Fabric Adoption Framework, making it easier to find what you need when you need it. 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which guide us in making these important decisions. Together, we’re shaping a documentation experience that truly serves you.
