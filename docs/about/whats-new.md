# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a fruitful month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the changes that have taken place. We’ve synchronized new content and updated our documentation structure to better serve you. This includes the addition of a License section, which is now easily accessible in the navigation menu. These updates not only enhance clarity but also ensure that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We’ve also made some thoughtful adjustments to improve your experience. For instance, we collapsed sidebar categories to reduce clutter and help you find what you need more efficiently. Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category, making it easier for you to explore the resources available for your Fabric adoption journey. I truly believe these changes will make your navigation smoother and your experience more enjoyable (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve taken significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which outlines key concepts and provides a roadmap for users navigating this new territory (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This is a crucial development, as it not only clarifies our objectives but also empowers you with the knowledge to effectively engage with the framework.

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing older, less relevant files that may have caused confusion (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). Simplifying our resources is essential for ensuring that you can find the information you need without unnecessary distractions. I truly believe these changes will foster a more intuitive navigation experience for everyone involved.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support throughout this process. Your engagement is what makes this project thrive. I’m eager to see how these updates will impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something meaningful!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. While it served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment matters because it allows us to declutter the navigation and make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated announcements. By simplifying our structure, we hope to create a more intuitive experience that keeps you focused on the resources that truly matter. I want to express my gratitude to our contributors and community members who provided valuable feedback that guided this decision.

As we move forward, I anticipate that these changes will foster a more engaging and user-friendly environment for all of you. I’m excited about the journey ahead and look forward to seeing how these updates help you in your adoption efforts. Thank you for being part of our community!
