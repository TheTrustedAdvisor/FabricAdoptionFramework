# What's new

## August 2025

August has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework! We’ve made some meaningful updates to enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section, which now has its own link in the navigation menu. This makes it easier for you to understand the terms under which our content is shared (Read more ›). We’ve also synchronized new content from our development repository, ensuring that you have access to the latest insights and strategies for Fabric adoption (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we collapsed some sidebar categories, making it simpler for you to navigate through the documentation (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category, so you can quickly find the resources you need to support your adoption journey (Read more ›). These changes matter because they create a more intuitive and user-friendly environment, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: successfully adopting Fabric.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support. Your engagement helps us continuously refine and enhance our documentation, making it a better resource for everyone. I’m excited about the impact these updates will have on your experience, and I can’t wait to hear your feedback!

Why does this matter? Well, having clear and accessible documentation is crucial for you, our community, as it empowers you to navigate the adoption process with confidence. We’ve worked hard to ensure that the information is not only comprehensive but also user-friendly.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This was a tough decision, but we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and helpful information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our documentation, we aim to make it easier for you to navigate and find what you need without unnecessary distractions. We understand that your time is valuable, and we want to ensure that every moment spent on our site is productive and enjoyable. I truly believe this will create a more cohesive experience for everyone involved. Thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback, which helped guide these changes.

As we continue to evolve, your input remains invaluable. I’m excited to see how these adjustments will impact your journey with us, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts! Together, we can make this framework even better. (Read more ›) [19 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30)
