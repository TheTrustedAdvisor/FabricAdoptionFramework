# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in improving our documentation. One of the standout changes is the addition of a License section, which not only clarifies how you can use our resources but also promotes transparency (Read more ›). We’ve also streamlined our navigation by adding a direct link to this License section, making it easier for you to find important information (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to make our content more accessible, we’ve collapsed the sidebar categories for better clarity. This should help you navigate through our resources more intuitively, allowing you to focus on what matters most to you (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve updated the visibility of our strategy category, ensuring that you can easily locate the strategies that will aid in your Fabric adoption journey (Read more ›). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts make a real difference in creating a welcoming and user-friendly environment for our community. I'm looking forward to seeing how these changes will support your exploration and adoption of Fabric. Until next time!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and user-friendly documentation experience. We introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a clear overview of what to expect and how to navigate the resources available to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). This change is significant because it sets a solid foundation for understanding our framework and its purpose, making it easier for you to find the information you need.

In addition to the new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This decluttering not only improves navigation but also helps to focus your attention on the most pertinent information. I genuinely believe that these changes will make your journey through the documentation smoother and more enjoyable.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable, and I’m thrilled to see our community come together to create a more engaging and accessible resource. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts on these changes and how they impact your experience!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month has brought some significant changes to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision stems from our desire to streamline the content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on more relevant sections, we hope to enhance your overall experience as you navigate through our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this shift will help us create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to reduce clutter and allow you to focus on the core content that supports your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. It’s all about making your experience smoother and more intuitive (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
