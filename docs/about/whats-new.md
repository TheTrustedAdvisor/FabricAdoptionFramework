## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, I want to share some significant changes we've made to enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this may seem like a big shift, we believe it will streamline your navigation and allow you to focus more on the content that truly matters to you. You can read more about this decision [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. By simplifying our structure, we hope to make it easier for you to find the information you need without the distraction of outdated sections. It’s all about ensuring that you can engage with our content in a way that feels intuitive and supportive. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their input on this decision. Your feedback is invaluable!

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these adjustments will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’re always here to listen and improve, so please don’t hesitate to share your thoughts with us. Together, we can continue to create a welcoming and informative space for everyone.
