We've made significant strides in enhancing the content and navigation, all aimed at making your experience smoother and more enriching. One of the highlights is the addition of a new License section, which you can now easily access through the navigation menu. This change is important as it clarifies the terms under which our documentation can be used, ensuring transparency and fostering trust within our community (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our resources, we’ve also collapsed some sidebar categories for clarity.

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made after careful consideration, as we believe that a more streamlined approach will help you find the information you need more efficiently. You can read about this change in detail [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, by simplifying our structure, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. We want you to spend less time searching for updates and more time engaging with the content that truly matters to you. We anticipate that this will lead to a more intuitive journey through our documentation, making it easier for everyone to stay informed and connected.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable in shaping our documentation, and we’re excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience. Together, we’re building something special!
