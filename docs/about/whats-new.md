# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we focused on refining our content and navigation to make it easier for you to find the information you need. We’ve added a new License section to our documentation, along with a link in the navigation menu, ensuring that you have quick access to important licensing information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md) (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md). 

Additionally, we’ve made strides in organizing our content by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity. This change is all about making your navigation smoother and more intuitive, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—adopting and implementing our framework effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational resource for understanding and implementing our practices. This new content is designed to be accessible and informative, making it easier for you to navigate the framework and find the guidance you need. You can dive into the details of this addition [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some significant changes by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current direction. This cleanup was essential to ensure that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information. By streamlining our resources, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience, allowing you to focus on what truly matters. If you're curious about these updates, you can read more about the removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these changes. Your input is what drives us to improve and adapt, and I can't wait to see how these updates will impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we are building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant change to our documentation that I want to share with you. We've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While this may seem like a small adjustment, it reflects our commitment to streamline your experience and focus on the content that truly matters. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our navigation and eliminating redundant sections, we hope to make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may not be relevant. This change is all about enhancing your journey through our documentation, ensuring that you can access the most pertinent content with ease. For further details on this change, feel free to explore [this link](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I genuinely believe that these adjustments will lead to a more cohesive and enjoyable experience for all of you. Thank you for your continued support and feedback, which inspire us to make these improvements. Together, we’re creating a space that prioritizes your needs and enhances your understanding.
