# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in improving our documentation’s clarity and accessibility. Notably, we expanded the visibility of our strategy category, making it easier for you to find the information you need when exploring our methodologies (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c741c0df7564954cd2fd203e9fcb7d50b956.md). We also collapsed some sidebar categories to streamline navigation, ensuring you can focus on what matters most without unnecessary distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

In addition, we’ve updated our documentation to include a License section and added a link to it in the navigation menu, which is a crucial step towards transparency and understanding our framework’s usage (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). These changes matter because they not only improve your ability to navigate our resources but also foster a sense of trust and community around our framework. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors who helped bring these updates to life; your efforts truly make a difference!

As we continue to refine our documentation, I hope these changes empower you to engage more deeply with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we are building a supportive environment where everyone can thrive.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the wonderful updates we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve laid down the initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational resource for anyone looking to navigate this journey with us. This content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to understand and implement the framework in your projects. You can check out the details about this initial documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer necessary. This cleanup helps to ensure that you find only the most relevant and useful information as you explore the framework. By focusing on what truly matters, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

These changes are significant because they reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, concise, and actionable guidance. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their invaluable feedback and support in shaping this framework. Together, we’re building something meaningful, and I can’t wait to see how you all use these resources in your own work!
