## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the framework’s initial content, which is designed to guide you through the adoption process. You can find this foundational information in our newly created sections, including an overview that provides a clear pathway for navigating the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). 

We also took the time to refine our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our vision. This streamlining effort helps ensure that you have access to the most relevant and useful information as you embark on your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This was a tough choice, but we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant information without redundancy (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our structure, we aim to make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through multiple sections. We want your journey through our documentation to be as smooth and intuitive as possible. This change reflects our commitment to continuous improvement based on your feedback and usage patterns, and I genuinely hope it makes your experience more enjoyable.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision. Your insights are invaluable, and they help us create a better resource for all. I’m excited to see how these changes positively impact your engagement with our documentation. Let’s keep moving forward together!
