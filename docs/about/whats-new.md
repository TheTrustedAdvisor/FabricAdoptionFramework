While this might seem like a big shift, it allows us to streamline our information and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging content. You can read more about this change in detail here: [Read more ›](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our structure, we hope to make your journey through our resources smoother and more intuitive. It’s all about creating a more cohesive experience that resonates with your needs and helps you adopt our framework more effectively. 

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to this transition. Your feedback has been invaluable in guiding these changes.
