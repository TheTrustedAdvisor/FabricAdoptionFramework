# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation, ensuring that you can find the information you need more easily. One of the highlights this month is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a dedicated link in the navigation menu (Read more ›). This change not only clarifies our licensing terms but also makes it more accessible for you.

Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation, allowing you to explore our published strategies for Fabric adoption with greater ease (Read more ›). This enhancement is all about making your journey smoother and more intuitive as you navigate through the resources we offer. We also streamlined the sidebar categories for clarity, which should help you quickly locate the topics that matter most to you (Read more ›).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that truly enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation. We introduced initial content that outlines the Fabric Adoption Framework, providing you with a clearer understanding of its purpose and structure (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This is a big deal because it means you now have a comprehensive resource to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and implement the framework in your projects.

In addition to adding new content, we also made some thoughtful adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our vision (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This streamlining effort is crucial; it helps us focus on providing you with the most relevant and up-to-date information, ensuring that your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework is as smooth as possible.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your input and support are invaluable to us, and we’re excited to see how these updates will positively impact your experience. Together, we’re building a vibrant community around the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I can’t wait to see how you all use these new resources!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to improving your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small change, it was made with careful consideration of how we can streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By eliminating this section, we aim to enhance the overall navigation and structure of our documentation. We believe that this will help you focus more on the core content that truly matters, rather than sifting through updates that may not be as relevant to your journey. This adjustment is part of our broader goal to create a more user-friendly experience, and I genuinely hope it makes your visits to our site more enjoyable and efficient.

Thank you to everyone in our community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights guide us as we strive to make our documentation a better resource for all. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes impact your experience!
