Additionally, we've made strides in organizing our content by collapsing sidebar categories for better clarity. This should make it easier for you to navigate through the various resources we offer. We also updated our strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information as you adopt Fabric (Read more ›). 

These changes matter because they reflect our dedication to creating a more user-friendly environment for you.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without the clutter of redundant updates (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md). 

I believe this change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. By eliminating this section, we hope to encourage you to explore the documentation more deeply, focusing on the content that truly supports your journey with the framework. It’s all about making your navigation smoother and your experience richer, and I genuinely think this will have a positive impact on how you engage with our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
