## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

We also took the time to refine our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that what you see is streamlined and focused.

We want to make your journey as smooth as possible, and these changes are a step in that direction (Read more ›).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! June has brought some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made after careful consideration of how we can streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without unnecessary clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating this section, we aim to improve the overall navigation experience for you, our valued users. We want to ensure that you can easily access the most relevant and up-to-date information without sifting through outdated announcements. This change is all about enhancing your experience and making our documentation more user-friendly, which is something we deeply care about.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and community members who provided feedback and insights that guided this decision. Your voices are vital in shaping our documentation, and I look forward to seeing how these updates positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.
