## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. While it might seem like a small adjustment, it reflects our commitment to streamline your experience and ensure that you can find the information you need more easily. We believe that by focusing on the core content and enhancing the overall navigation, we can create a more intuitive journey through our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it allows us to declutter the documentation and prioritize the most relevant and useful information for you. We want to ensure that every visit to our site feels welcoming and productive, and this adjustment is a step in that direction. We appreciate the community's feedback that guided us towards this decision, and we hope it enhances your experience as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, we expect that this streamlined approach will make it easier for you to navigate our resources and find what you need without unnecessary distractions. Thank you for being a part of our journey and for your ongoing support. Your insights help us grow and improve every day (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3c8a7680b53803895844a260b5c0e2e3af54af2e.md). Together, we’re building something special! (11 commits)
