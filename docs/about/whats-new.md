# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates we've made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We've been hard at work, and I think you'll find these changes enhance your experience significantly. For starters, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, along with a handy link in the navigation menu. This addition not only clarifies our usage policies but also makes it easier for you to find important information about how to use our framework responsibly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

In our effort to streamline your navigation experience, we collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity. This change aims to help you find what you need more quickly and intuitively, making your journey through our documentation smoother (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! This July, I’m thrilled to share some exciting developments on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. We've made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, particularly with the introduction of initial content for the adoption framework. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement the framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having clear and comprehensive documentation is crucial for you to feel confident in navigating the framework. This initial content lays a solid foundation, ensuring that you have the resources you need right at your fingertips. Additionally, we’ve streamlined our navigation by removing outdated documentation files that no longer serve our purpose, allowing for a more focused and user-friendly experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a resource that truly meets the needs of our community. As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will enhance your experience and support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, this decision was made to streamline your experience and make navigation more intuitive. We believe that by integrating updates directly into the relevant sections of our documentation, you’ll find the information you need more quickly and easily. If you’re curious about the specifics of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This shift matters because it reflects our commitment to enhancing your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We want to ensure that you can focus on what truly matters—adopting and benefiting from our framework—without getting sidetracked by separate sections for updates. By embedding the latest information directly where it’s most relevant, we hope to create a smoother, more cohesive reading experience. 

I want to take a moment to thank our wonderful contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback, which helps us make these important decisions. We’re excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience as you explore our documentation. Together, we’re making strides toward a more user-friendly resource for everyone involved.
