# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful updates we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve synchronized new content that aligns with our evolving strategies, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and comprehensive resources. This includes the addition of a License section, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu (Read more ›). These updates are designed to make your journey smoother and more informative.

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories, making it easier for you to navigate through the documentation. This change is all about helping you find what you need without unnecessary distractions (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve streamlined our published strategy methodology documents, which should provide you with clearer insights into our approach to Fabric adoption (Read more ›).

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we took significant steps to enhance our documentation and make it more accessible for you, our readers. We’ve introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This content will serve as a vital resource for anyone looking to navigate the adoption process smoothly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also refined our structure by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer align with our current direction. This cleanup not only declutters the site but also ensures that you have access to the most relevant and useful information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac.md). I truly believe that these changes will make your experience more intuitive and enjoyable, allowing you to focus on what matters most—adopting the framework effectively.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this progress. Your input and support are invaluable as we continue to evolve and improve our resources. I am excited to see how these updates will empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building a stronger community!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant shift in our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. While this might seem like a big change, we believe it's a step towards a more streamlined experience for you. By consolidating our updates into other areas of the site, we aim to make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through multiple sections. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made with your experience in mind. We want to ensure that our documentation remains user-friendly and intuitive. By integrating updates directly into relevant topics, you’ll have a clearer view of how changes impact your work. We hope this will foster a more cohesive understanding of our framework and its evolution. Thank you to everyone in our community who provided feedback and insights that guided us in this direction.

As we continue to grow and adapt, we’re excited about the potential impact of these changes. We believe that a more integrated approach will not only enhance your navigation experience but also encourage deeper engagement with our content. Let’s keep moving forward together!
