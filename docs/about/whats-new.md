# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some wonderful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a dedicated License section, which you can now easily find in our navigation menu. This not only clarifies the usage rights but also demonstrates our commitment to transparency and accessibility (Read more ›).

We've also made strides in organizing our content more effectively. By collapsing sidebar categories, we've aimed to create a cleaner and more intuitive navigation experience. This means you can now find what you need more quickly and with less clutter. Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most relevant and up-to-date information at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and the community for their hard work and dedication in making these changes possible. Your feedback and support continue to shape our documentation into a resource that truly serves you. As we move forward, I hope these updates will make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even smoother and more enjoyable.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant updates we’ve made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this July. We’ve rolled out initial content that lays the groundwork for our adoption framework, which I believe will be a tremendous resource for you as you navigate your journey with us. This new content not only introduces the framework but also provides an overview that helps clarify its purpose and how it can benefit your adoption process (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to adding this foundational content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer aligned with our vision. This cleanup helps ensure that you can find the most relevant and useful information without any distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these updates possible. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we continue to enhance our documentation.

I hope these changes make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even smoother and more enjoyable. As we move forward, I’m excited to see how this initial content will empower you on your adoption journey. Thank you for being a part of our community, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts!

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation more user-friendly and streamlined. This month, we made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this may seem like a big change, it’s part of our effort to simplify navigation and ensure that our content is as relevant and accessible as possible for you. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By removing the "What's New" section, we’re focusing on integrating updates directly into the relevant documentation, allowing you to find the latest information in context rather than having to sift through a separate section. This should make your experience smoother and more intuitive as you navigate through the resources available. I truly believe that this change will have a positive impact on how you interact with our documentation.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which helps us continuously refine our approach. Your input is invaluable as we strive to create a welcoming and informative environment for everyone. If you’re curious about the specifics of this change, feel free to check out the details [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md). Let’s keep this journey going together! (Read more ›) [10 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30)
