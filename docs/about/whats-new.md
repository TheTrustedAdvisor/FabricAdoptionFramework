# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve added new content that will guide you through the intricacies of our framework, ensuring you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips. You can check out the full details on our [new content sync](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-08-08-29aca670872315962827412318cbc8e797896e58.md) and the [initial project setup](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-08-08-a041324520013fc070f5eaa6640321fba0be44a7.md) that lays a strong foundation for your journey with us.

We also listened to your feedback and made some structural improvements, like collapsing sidebar categories for clarity. This change is all about making navigation smoother and helping you find what you need without any hassle (you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md)). Additionally, we’ve introduced a License section and updated our navigation menu to include a direct link to it, which we hope will clarify usage rights and foster a transparent relationship with our community (find out more [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md)).

These updates matter because they not only improve your experience but also reflect our commitment to keeping the documentation relevant and user-friendly. We’re optimistic that these changes will empower you as you navigate your adoption journey, and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these enhancements. Your input is invaluable, and together, we’re building something truly special.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and comprehensive approach to our documentation. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which aims to provide you with clear guidelines and resources to navigate your adoption journey effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having a solid foundation is crucial for anyone looking to adopt new practices or tools. By establishing this framework, we hope to make your path smoother and more intuitive. We’ve also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current vision, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and useful information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I genuinely believe these changes will empower you as you engage with the framework. A heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and input, which has been invaluable in shaping this content. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates will positively impact your experience!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" section entirely. While this section has served us well, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make navigation more intuitive for you. By consolidating updates into other relevant areas, we hope to create a more cohesive experience that allows you to find the information you need without any unnecessary clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment matters because it reflects our commitment to continuously improving the way you interact with our documentation. We want you to feel supported and guided as you explore our resources, and we believe that simplifying our structure will help achieve that goal. Your feedback has always been invaluable, and this change is a direct response to your insights and suggestions.

I am genuinely excited about the potential impact of these updates. By focusing on clarity and accessibility, we hope to empower you to navigate our documentation with ease and confidence. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision and continues to share your thoughts with us. Together, we’re building something truly special!
