# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation. You’ll notice that we’ve added a new License section, which is now easily accessible from the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also fosters transparency within our community (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to make information more digestible, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity. This should help you find what you need more quickly without feeling overwhelmed by options. Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most relevant and up-to-date resources at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts truly make a difference in how our community interacts with the framework.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some wonderful updates with you. We’ve made significant strides by introducing the initial content for our adoption framework, which is now live and ready for you to explore. This foundational material lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively adopt Fabric within your projects. You can check out the details in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md) and the [overview](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to adding new content, we've also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our purpose. This streamlining helps ensure that you have access to the most relevant and helpful information as you navigate the framework. It’s all about making your experience smoother and more intuitive, and I truly believe these changes will have a positive impact on how you engage with our resources.

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your insights and efforts are what make this community thrive, and I’m excited to see how these new resources will support your journey with Fabric. As always, I’m here cheering you on as you explore and adopt these frameworks in your work!

By simplifying our navigation and focusing on the most relevant content, we hope to provide a more cohesive experience.
