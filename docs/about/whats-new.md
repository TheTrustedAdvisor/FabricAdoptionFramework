## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the meaningful changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve worked hard to sync new content and improve our documentation structure, ensuring that you have access to the latest insights and strategies for adopting Fabric effectively. You can dive into the details of our content updates in the [changes log](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-08-08-29aca670872315962827412318cbc8e797896e58.md).

One of the highlights this month is the addition of a License section, which is now easily accessible in our navigation menu. This change not only clarifies the usage rights of our materials but also reflects our commitment to transparency and open collaboration.

You can dive into the details of this new content in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md) and the [overview](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

We also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, allowing us to streamline the information you receive. This change is important because it helps ensure that you have access to the most pertinent and up-to-date resources without any clutter.
