Why does this matter? Well, our goal has always been to enhance your experience and ensure that our documentation serves you better. By simplifying our navigation and focusing on core content, we hope to create a more intuitive environment for you to explore. We believe this will lead to a more efficient way for you to engage with the materials, allowing you to dive right into the content that matters most to you.
