## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made after careful consideration, as we found that consolidating our updates into more streamlined formats would help you find the information you need more efficiently. You can read more about this change [here](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30).

I truly believe this shift will make navigating our documentation smoother and more intuitive. By focusing on integrating updates directly into relevant sections, we aim to provide a more cohesive reading experience. It’s all about making your journey with us as seamless as possible, and I’m excited for the positive impact this will have on your engagement with the material.

A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to these changes. Your feedback and insights are invaluable, and they help us continuously improve the resources we offer. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates resonate with you! (Read more ›)
