# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we focused on refining our documentation and making it more user-friendly. We’ve added a new License section to the documentation, along with a link in the navigation menu to ensure you can easily find this essential information (Read more ›). This change matters because transparency is key in our community, and we want you to feel informed and secure as you engage with our resources.

Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation (Read more ›). This means that you’ll have easier access to the strategies that can guide your adoption journey. We also made some structural changes by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, helping you navigate through the content with ease (Read more ›). I hope these adjustments make your exploration of the framework feel more intuitive and enjoyable.

Lastly, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and collaboration. Your feedback and engagement help us grow and improve, and I can’t wait to see how these updates impact your experience. Together, we’re building something great!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation. We’ve added initial content that outlines our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of integrating Fabric into your projects. This new content is not just a collection of guidelines; it’s a resource crafted with your needs in mind, ensuring that you can easily navigate the adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing some of the initial files that were no longer relevant. This decluttering helps create a more focused and user-friendly experience, allowing you to find the information you need without sifting through outdated materials. We believe this will make your journey smoother and more enjoyable (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). 

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your feedback and support have been invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve our community. As we continue to grow and evolve, I’m excited to see how these updates will empower you in your adoption of the Fabric framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). Together, we’re building something great! (115 commits)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant adjustments to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This change was made with the intention of streamlining our content and making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By eliminating redundancy, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience throughout the site (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will have a positive impact on how you interact with our resources. With the removal of this section, we aim to direct your focus towards the core content that supports your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Our goal is to provide clarity and ease of access, allowing you to engage more meaningfully with the materials available (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md). 

A heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback, which help us shape a better experience for everyone. I’m excited to see how these changes will enhance your exploration of our documentation. Let’s continue this journey together!
