# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that truly enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a License section, which now has its own dedicated link in the navigation menu. This is a crucial step in ensuring that you have easy access to our licensing information, making it clearer and more transparent for everyone involved (Read more ›).

We’ve also taken the time to synchronize our published strategy methodology documents and expand the visibility of the strategy category within our documentation. This means that you can now find the resources you need more easily, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—adopting and implementing the Fabric framework effectively (Read more ›). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community members who have helped us bring these changes to life. Your input is invaluable and makes a real difference.

Lastly, we’ve made some adjustments to the sidebar, collapsing categories for better clarity. This should streamline your navigation experience, making it easier to find what you’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed. I hope these updates make your journey with us even more enjoyable and productive (Read more ›). Thank you for being part of our community!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month marked a significant milestone as we added initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. You can check out the details of this addition [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

In addition to this new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline our resources and ensures that you can easily find the most pertinent information without wading through outdated materials. If you're curious about what was removed, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with the best possible guidance and support as you navigate the adoption framework. By focusing on clarity and relevance, we hope to empower you to make informed decisions and foster a smoother implementation process. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts truly make a difference! I can't wait to see how these enhancements impact your journey.
