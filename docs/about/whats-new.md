# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the meaningful changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve synchronized a wealth of new content, including our published strategies for Fabric adoption, which I believe will provide you with clearer guidance and insights as you navigate your journey with us (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation, making it easier for you to find the resources you need (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we’ve also collapsed some sidebar categories. This change is designed to streamline your navigation, allowing you to focus on what truly matters without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Plus, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, which is essential for transparency and understanding how you can use our resources (Read more ›). A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who have helped bring these updates to life; your efforts are truly appreciated!

As we continue to refine and enhance our documentation, I hope these changes help you feel more connected and informed. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates impact your experience and support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the wonderful changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and apply our framework in your work (Read more ›).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter the site and ensures that you can find the information you need without sifting through outdated materials (Read more ›). It’s all about creating a more intuitive and user-friendly experience for you. I truly believe these updates will make it easier for you to engage with the framework and feel supported on your journey.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your feedback and collaboration are invaluable, and they help us create a resource that truly meets your needs. I’m excited to see how these updates will impact your work and the community as a whole. Together, we’re building something special!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience navigating our site. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While it served its purpose for a time, we felt that consolidating our updates into more streamlined formats would make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through multiple sections. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This shift is important because it reflects our commitment to clarity and accessibility. By minimizing redundancy in our documentation, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. We understand that your time is valuable, and our goal is to make it as easy as possible for you to access the insights and guidance you need to adopt our framework effectively. You can find more details about the rationale behind this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights help shape our documentation and ensure it meets your needs. I’m excited about the positive impact these changes will have on your journey with us and look forward to continuing to improve our resources together.
