# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the changes that have been made to enhance your experience. We've synchronized new content and updated our documentation, ensuring that you have the most relevant information at your fingertips. This includes the addition of a License section, which now has its own link in the navigation menu, making it easier for you to find and understand the legal aspects of our framework (Read more ›). 

We've also worked on improving the structure of our documentation by collapsing sidebar categories for better clarity. This change was made with you in mind, as we want to make navigating through our resources as seamless as possible (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category, so you can easily access the strategies that are key to your Fabric adoption journey (Read more ›). 

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support make a real difference in how we evolve our documentation. I hope these changes help you feel more empowered as you explore and adopt the Fabric framework. Together, we’re making great strides!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid down the groundwork for our adoption framework with the introduction of initial content. This is a significant step forward, as it provides you with a clearer understanding of how to effectively adopt and implement the framework in your own projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this, we’ve refined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This decluttering helps streamline your navigation and makes it easier for you to find the information you truly need (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I genuinely believe that these changes will make your journey through our resources more intuitive and enjoyable.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your input and dedication make a real difference, and I’m excited to see how these enhancements will positively impact our community. Together, we’re building a valuable resource that I hope will empower all of you in your adoption journeys!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework as seamless as possible. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this may seem like a small adjustment, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and helpful information without redundancy (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to enhance your navigation experience, ensuring that you can find the information you need without sifting through outdated updates. This change is all about clarity and accessibility, allowing you to dive straight into the content that matters most to you. I truly appreciate the feedback from our community that guided us in making this decision, and I hope it makes your journey with us even more enjoyable.

As we move forward, we expect this shift to foster a more intuitive user experience and encourage you to engage with the core materials of the framework more effectively. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support as we evolve together. Your input is invaluable, and I look forward to bringing you more updates in the future!
