# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we focused on streamlining our content and making it more accessible. You’ll notice that we’ve synced new content, including our initial project setup and documentation, which provides a clearer starting point for newcomers (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy categories, making it easier for you to find the resources you need (Read more ›).

Why does this matter? Well, I truly believe that a well-organized and clear documentation site is vital for your journey in adopting Fabric. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we’ve aimed to reduce clutter and help you navigate more intuitively (Read more ›). Plus, we’ve added a License section to the documentation and a corresponding link in the navigation menu, ensuring you have all the essential information at your fingertips (Read more ›). These changes are not just about aesthetics; they’re about creating a welcoming environment where you can learn and grow.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable, and they help us create a better experience for all. I hope you find these changes helpful and that they empower you on your Fabric adoption journey. Together, let’s keep moving forward!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enriching. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. This foundational information is crucial as it sets the stage for how we can all work together to embrace and implement the framework effectively. You can dive into the details of these changes here: [Add initial content for adoption framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-99bbd7955c423e1670f1e1e9f3b50a9a79f6860f.md).

In addition to introducing new content, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated documentation that no longer aligns with our vision. This helps to streamline our resources and ensures that you have access to the most relevant and helpful information. It’s all about creating a more intuitive navigation experience for you, our valued readers.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your input and collaboration are what make this community so special. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes will help us all adopt the framework more seamlessly and effectively. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I hope this message finds you well and thriving. This month, we made a significant change that I want to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section from our website. This decision was not taken lightly, but we believe it will streamline your experience and help you find the information you need more efficiently. You can read about this change in detail [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to make it easier for you to navigate and discover the resources that are most relevant to your needs. We understand that your time is valuable, and we want to ensure that you can focus on what truly matters—adopting and implementing our framework effectively. I truly appreciate the feedback from our community that led to this improvement, and I’m excited about the positive impact it will have on your experience.

As we continue to evolve and adapt, I’m grateful for your support and engagement. Every contribution helps us create a better resource for everyone. I hope you find these changes beneficial, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts as we move forward together. Thank you for being part of this journey with us!
