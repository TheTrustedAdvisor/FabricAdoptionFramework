## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content to make it even more accessible and user-friendly. For instance, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category, which means you can now find relevant strategies more easily than ever before (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c741c0df7564954cd2fd203e9fcb7d50b956.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the wonderful changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This new content is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, ensuring that you have the resources you need right at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter our site, making it easier for you to navigate and find the information that truly matters (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). By refining our structure, we hope to create a more intuitive experience that allows you to focus on what you need without the distraction of outdated materials.

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a resource that serves our community well. As we continue to grow and evolve, I hope these changes empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we are building something special!

## June 2025

June has brought some significant changes to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I want to share with you. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This change was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may no longer be relevant. By consolidating our resources, we hope to enhance your overall experience and ensure that you have access to the most pertinent information right at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe this update matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a more user-friendly navigation experience. We understand that your time is valuable, and by simplifying our structure, we aim to help you focus on what truly counts—the content that supports your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in the community who contributed to this decision; your insights have been invaluable in shaping our documentation.

As we move forward, I expect these changes will foster a more engaging and efficient interaction with our resources. We’re excited about the potential for deeper connections and clearer communication as we continue to evolve. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!
