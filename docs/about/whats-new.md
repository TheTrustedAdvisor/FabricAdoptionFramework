Additionally, we’ve added a dedicated License section to our documentation, making it easier for you to understand the terms under which our resources are provided (Read more ›). 

We also took a thoughtful approach to our navigation, collapsing sidebar categories for clarity.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enriching. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational resource for understanding and implementing our approach. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also made some significant changes by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current framework. This streamlining is essential as it helps clarify our resources and ensures that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information. You can read more about this cleanup process [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). 

These updates matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, concise, and actionable guidance. We hope that by refining our content and structure, you will feel more empowered to adopt and implement the framework effectively. A heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community for your ongoing support and collaboration in making these changes possible. Together, we’re building something truly valuable!

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section entirely. While it might seem like a big step, we believe this will streamline your experience and make it easier to find the most relevant information without sifting through past updates. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision stems from our commitment to enhance your journey through our resources. By simplifying the navigation and focusing on the content that matters most, we hope to create a more intuitive experience for everyone. We understand that your time is valuable, and we want to ensure that you can quickly access the information you need without unnecessary distractions. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights help us shape a better documentation experience for all. Together, we’re making strides toward a more user-friendly environment, and I can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your journey with us.
