Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the wonderful changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve added initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices.

In our quest to streamline the documentation, we’ve also removed some initial files that were no longer relevant. This clean-up not only declutters our site but also helps you focus on the most pertinent information. By establishing a clearer structure, we hope to guide you more effectively through the resources available, making your journey smoother and more intuitive (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and community for their invaluable input and support. Your feedback is what drives us to improve continuously. We believe these updates will make a significant impact on how you interact with our framework, fostering a deeper understanding and more effective adoption of our practices. Together, we’re building something special! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This change was made after careful consideration and feedback from our community, as we aim to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without unnecessary clutter. If you want to dive deeper into the details of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. The removal of this section allows us to focus on the core content that truly matters to your journey with the framework. This way, you can spend less time searching and more time implementing the strategies that will help you succeed. It’s all about making your experience smoother and more enjoyable!

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone in our community who provided feedback and contributed to this decision. Your voices are invaluable, and I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your engagement with our documentation. Together, we’re building something great!
