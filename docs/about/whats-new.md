# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our documentation to make it more user-friendly. One of the most notable changes is the collapse of sidebar categories for clarity, which should help you navigate our resources more easily (Read more ›). We also expanded the visibility of our strategy category, ensuring that you can quickly find the information you need when exploring strategies for Fabric adoption (Read more ›).

In addition to these navigation improvements, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu. This is an important step in promoting transparency and ensuring you have easy access to the licensing information that governs our content (Read more ›). I believe these changes will not only streamline your journey through our documentation but also foster a deeper understanding of our framework.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable, and it truly helps us create a better experience for everyone. I hope you find these updates helpful as you continue to explore the Fabric Adoption Framework!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant updates from July 2025 that truly enhance our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This is a big step forward in making our resources more accessible and user-friendly, and I believe it will help you navigate the framework with greater ease.

In addition to adding new content, we also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline our resources and ensures that you’re only seeing the most pertinent information. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these updates possible. Your feedback is invaluable, and it helps us create a better experience for everyone.

Overall, these changes are designed to improve your journey through our documentation. By providing clearer guidance and removing outdated materials, we hope to foster a more intuitive and engaging learning environment. I can’t wait for you to explore the new content and see how it can support your adoption efforts!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made the significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a big change, it’s a step towards streamlining our content and making it easier for you to find the information you truly need. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment matters because we want to ensure that every part of our documentation serves a clear purpose and contributes to your understanding of the framework. By removing the "What's New" section, we aim to declutter the navigation and focus on delivering more relevant and useful content directly related to your needs. We believe this will lead to a more intuitive experience as you explore our resources. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their continued support and feedback, which guide us in making these thoughtful changes. We’re excited about the impact this will have on your journey with us, and we hope it makes your experience even better!
