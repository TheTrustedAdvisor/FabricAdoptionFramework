We’ve been busy syncing new content and refining our documentation to ensure you have the most relevant and helpful information at your fingertips. One significant change is the addition of a License section, which is now easily accessible in the navigation menu.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This change is aimed at streamlining your experience and ensuring that you can find the information you need without any clutter. By consolidating our content, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. If you're curious about this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, I believe that a cleaner structure will help you focus on the core content that truly matters to your journey with the framework. We want to make it easier for you to access the resources and guidance you need, without sifting through sections that may no longer serve you. This is all about enhancing your experience and making our documentation feel more intuitive and welcoming.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to this decision and the implementation of these changes. Your feedback is invaluable, and it helps us shape a documentation experience that truly resonates with our community. I'm looking forward to seeing how these updates will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.
