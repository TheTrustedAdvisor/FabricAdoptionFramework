## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I can't wait to share the updates that have taken shape. We've rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational guide for anyone looking to understand and implement the framework effectively. This new content is designed with you in mind, making it easier to navigate and grasp the essentials of the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some of the initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter the site and ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I believe these changes will significantly enhance your experience as you explore the framework, making it a more welcoming and user-friendly space.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to improving your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a big shift, we believe it will streamline your navigation and help you find the information you need more efficiently.

The decision to remove this section came from thoughtful discussions within our community. We wanted to ensure that our documentation remains relevant and user-friendly, and we felt that consolidating information would enhance your overall experience. By focusing on the core content, we aim to make it easier for you to access the resources that matter most.
