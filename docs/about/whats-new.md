# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we focused on refining our content and navigation to make it easier for you to find what you need. We’ve added a new License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu (Read more ›). This clarity is essential because it helps you understand the terms under which you can use our resources.

In addition to that, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy category within the documentation (Read more ›). This change is significant as it allows you to navigate our strategies more intuitively, ensuring you can find the guidance you need without any hassle. We also made some adjustments to our sidebar categories to improve clarity, collapsing them for a cleaner look (Read more ›). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and collaboration. Your input truly shapes our documentation, making it more user-friendly and accessible for everyone. Together, we’re creating a space that empowers you on your adoption journey.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the meaningful updates we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced a wealth of initial content that lays the groundwork for our adoption framework.

We’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant, allowing us to focus on the most pertinent information for you. This not only declutters the navigation but also ensures that you can find what you need without sifting through outdated content (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to improving your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without unnecessary clutter. You can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to enhance your navigation experience. We want you to spend less time searching and more time engaging with the material that truly matters to you. This change is a step towards a more intuitive layout, ensuring that you can quickly access the most relevant resources and updates. I genuinely appreciate the feedback from our community that helped guide this decision.

As we move forward, I look forward to hearing how these adjustments impact your journey with the framework. Your insights are invaluable, and together, we can continue to refine our documentation to better serve you. Thank you for being part of this community and for your ongoing support!
