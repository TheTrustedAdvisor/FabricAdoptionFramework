# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation, including the addition of a new License section, which is now easily accessible in our navigation menu. This change not only clarifies the terms under which our content can be used but also fosters transparency and trust within our community (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

In our ongoing effort to make our resources more user-friendly, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity. This adjustment aims to streamline your navigation experience, allowing you to find what you need more quickly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our documentation with the latest strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-9993fe2ef400b1868a1874a379e6fe864b68fd0c.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for your continued support and collaboration.

## July 2025

Hello dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that provides a comprehensive overview and guidance for users. You can find this new content in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md), which aims to make your journey smoother and more intuitive.

Why does this matter? Well, having a structured framework is crucial for anyone looking to adopt our practices effectively. It’s designed to help you navigate through the complexities of implementation with ease and confidence. We also removed some outdated initial documentation to streamline our resources and ensure you have access to the most relevant information. This shift not only declutters our site but also highlights our commitment to providing you with the best possible guidance (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts have made a significant impact, and I’m hopeful that these updates will foster a more engaging and user-friendly experience for all. Together, we’re building a supportive community, and I can’t wait to see how you utilize these new resources.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change that I want to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section from our site. This was not an easy decision, but it was made with your experience in mind. We felt that consolidating our updates into a more streamlined format would help you find the information you need more easily and keep our content fresh and relevant. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, our goal is always to enhance your journey through our documentation. By removing the "What's New" section, we are aiming to create a more cohesive experience where updates are integrated throughout the content rather than isolated in one area. This change should make it easier for you to stay informed about the latest developments without having to search in multiple places. 

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to this decision and the ongoing improvements to our documentation. Your feedback is invaluable, and it helps us shape a better experience for all. I’m excited to see how this change positively impacts your navigation and understanding of our resources. If you want to dive deeper into the details, feel free to check out the full list of changes [here](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30).
