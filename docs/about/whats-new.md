## July 2025

July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share the changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement and benefit from our resources. This new content is designed to be approachable and informative, making it easier for you to navigate the framework and find what you need (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In our efforts to streamline the documentation, we’ve also removed some initial files that were no longer relevant, allowing us to focus on delivering the most useful and up-to-date information possible. This cleanup not only declutters the site but also ensures that you won’t have to sift through outdated materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community members for their invaluable input and support during this process. 

As we continue to refine and expand our documentation, I believe these changes will significantly enhance your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’re committed to making this resource as helpful and user-friendly as possible, and I can’t wait to see how you all utilize the new content to drive your projects forward (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).
