# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation. For instance, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our licensing but also makes it more straightforward for you to find important information (Read more ›).

Additionally, we’ve worked on improving the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation. By expanding this section, we aim to provide you with clearer and more accessible guidance on adopting Fabric strategies. We've also collapsed some sidebar categories to enhance clarity, making it easier for you to navigate through our resources without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we continue to grow and improve. I hope these changes make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enjoyable and productive!

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework documentation, introducing initial content that aims to guide you through the adoption process. You can find this foundational information in our new sections, which include an overview that succinctly outlines what the framework is all about (Read more ›) and the initial documentation that sets the stage for future enhancements (Read more ›). 

These changes are significant because they provide clarity and direction for anyone looking to adopt our framework. By establishing a clear structure and offering essential content, we hope to make your journey smoother and more intuitive. I genuinely believe that having this initial content will empower you to navigate the framework with confidence and ease. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who helped bring this vision to life; your efforts are truly appreciated.
