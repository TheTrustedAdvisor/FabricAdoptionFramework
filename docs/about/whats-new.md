## July 2025

Hello dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational guide to help you navigate and implement our practices effectively. It’s a big step forward in making our documentation more accessible and user-friendly, and I can’t wait for you to explore it! You can check out the details on the initial documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some of the initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter our resources and ensures that you’re only seeing the most pertinent information. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more intuitive as you dive into the framework. For more on the removals, you can read about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your dedication and insights are what make this community so special. I truly believe these updates will have a positive impact, helping you feel more confident and supported as you adopt the framework. Enjoy exploring the new content and let us know your thoughts!

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, I want to share some important updates that have taken place on our Fabric Adoption Framework website. We’ve made a significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This change reflects our ongoing commitment to streamline content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By consolidating updates into more cohesive sections, we hope to enhance your navigation experience and ensure that you can quickly access the most relevant resources. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this update is crucial because it helps us focus on delivering content that is not only informative but also user-friendly. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we can present our updates in a more integrated manner, allowing you to see how changes fit into the broader context of our framework. This approach is designed to foster a deeper understanding of our resources and their applications. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and for your ongoing support in making our documentation better for all.

As we move forward, I’m excited about the impact these changes will have on your experience with our documentation. I hope you find it easier to navigate and engage with the content, and I encourage you to share your thoughts and feedback with us. Your insights are invaluable as we continue to grow and improve together.
