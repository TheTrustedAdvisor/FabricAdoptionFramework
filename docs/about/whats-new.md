## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the updates that have come your way. We’ve made a significant leap forward by adding initial content for the adoption framework, which aims to provide you with a clearer understanding of how to effectively utilize our resources. This foundational content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and implement our framework in your projects. You can read all about it in our detailed updates here: [Add initial content for adoption framework (99bbd79)](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-99bbd7955c423e1670f1e1e9f3b50a9a79f6860f.md).

In addition to this exciting new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter your experience and ensures that you have access to only the most pertinent information. We believe that a cleaner, more focused documentation space will enhance your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework, and we hope you feel the difference as you explore. You can find more about this change here: [Remove initial documentation files for framework (3948fa7)](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable, and they make a real difference in how our community engages with the framework. As we continue to grow and evolve, I’m excited to see how these changes will help you in your adoption journey. Thank you for being part of this adventure with us!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation more user-friendly and accessible. This month, we made the significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this might seem like a big change, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on the most relevant information for you, our valued community. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to reduce clutter and enhance the overall navigation experience. Our goal is to ensure that you can easily find the information you need without sifting through outdated updates. We believe that this will make your journey through our documentation smoother and more enjoyable. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision; your feedback is invaluable to us.

As we move forward, we expect this change to create a more cohesive and engaging experience for all our users. We’re excited to see how this refined approach will help you navigate our resources with greater ease and confidence. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support!
