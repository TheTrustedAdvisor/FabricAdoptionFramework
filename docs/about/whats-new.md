# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we've made significant strides in organizing our content to make it more accessible and user-friendly. Notably, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, allowing you to navigate through our resources with greater ease (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category, ensuring that you can find the guidance you need without any hassle (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c741c0df7564954cd2fd203e9fcb7d50b956.md).

We’ve also added a License section to our documentation, which is essential for transparency and understanding how you can use our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). This addition not only clarifies our commitment to open collaboration but also empowers you to engage with our content confidently. In line with this, we’ve updated the navigation menu to include a direct link to the License, making it even easier for you to access this important information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your engagement helps us continuously improve and refine our documentation.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some meaningful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. This foundational content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement. You can explore the details in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md).

In addition to introducing new content, we also made some adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current direction. This cleanup helps streamline your navigation and ensures that you’re only seeing the most relevant information. By refining our resources, we aim to create a more intuitive experience for you as you explore the framework. You can read more about this in our [removal of initial documentation on Fabric Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your input and dedication are invaluable as we continue to build a robust and user-friendly resource. I hope these updates empower you in your adoption journey, and I can’t wait to see how you leverage the framework!

By consolidating our content, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience for everyone (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that changes like this can feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will enhance how you engage with our resources. We want to ensure that you can easily access the most relevant content without sifting through sections that may no longer serve you. This update reflects our commitment to listening to your feedback and continuously improving our platform (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
