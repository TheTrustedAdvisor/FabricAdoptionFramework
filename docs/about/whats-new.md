# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in syncing new content and refining our documentation structure. One of the highlights is the addition of a License section, which is now easily accessible through our navigation menu. This change is important because it clarifies the usage rights and responsibilities, making it easier for you to understand how to engage with our materials (Read more ›).

We've also focused on improving the visibility of our strategy documentation. By expanding the strategy category in our docs, we aim to provide you with a clearer path to the resources you need. This should make navigating our content feel more intuitive and supportive of your journey with Fabric adoption. Additionally, we’ve streamlined the sidebar categories for better clarity, which I hope will make finding information a breeze (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights drive our improvements and help us create a more user-friendly experience for everyone. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes impact your work and engagement with the framework!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some significant updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial documentation that outlines its purpose and structure. You can dive into the details of this new content in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md) as well as the [overview](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md) that sets the stage for what’s to come.

Why does this matter? Well, these changes are designed to provide you with a clearer understanding of how to effectively adopt and implement the framework in your projects. By establishing this foundational content, we aim to make your journey smoother and more informed. We’ve also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that you have access to only the most pertinent information. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I genuinely believe that these updates will have a positive impact on how you engage with the framework, making it easier for you to find the resources you need. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this effort; your input is invaluable as we continue to grow and refine our documentation. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes support you in your adoption journey!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. I know this may come as a surprise, but we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By consolidating updates into a more integrated format, we aim to enhance your overall experience and ensure that you can navigate our resources with ease. If you're curious about the details of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was driven by feedback from our wonderful community, and I want to take a moment to thank each of you for your input. Your voices are invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve your needs. We believe that by removing the "What's New" section, we can create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience that highlights the most relevant updates directly within the context of the content you’re exploring.

As we move forward, we anticipate that this change will not only simplify your navigation but also foster a more engaging learning environment. We’re excited to see how this new structure will help you connect with our materials more effectively. Thank you for being a part of our journey, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these updates!
