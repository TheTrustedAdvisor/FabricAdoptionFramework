Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve synchronized a wealth of new content, which includes the initial project setup and documentation. These updates are designed to provide you with a clearer understanding of our framework and how to navigate it effectively (Read more ›).

We’ve also made some thoughtful adjustments to our navigation. You’ll notice that we’ve added a License section to the documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu. This change not only helps clarify usage rights but also makes it easier for you to find important information quickly (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for improved clarity, ensuring that you can focus on what matters most without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their continuous support and feedback.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the updates that have taken shape. We’ve made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework, which now provides a solid foundation for you to explore. This new content is designed to guide you through the framework's principles and practices, making it easier for you to navigate and adopt our solutions effectively. You can check out the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps ensure that our resources are focused and accessible, allowing you to find the information you need without unnecessary clutter. I believe this will enhance your experience as you delve into the framework. If you're curious about the changes we made, you can read more about the removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even better. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this may seem like a small adjustment, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on delivering the most relevant information directly to you. If you're curious about the specifics of this change, you can check out the details here: [Read more ›](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to enhance your navigation experience. We want you to find what you need quickly and easily, without unnecessary distractions. This change is a step toward creating a more cohesive and user-friendly environment that prioritizes your needs and feedback. I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have guided us in making these decisions.

As we move forward, I believe this adjustment will lead to a more focused and engaging experience for all of you. Your insights and suggestions are invaluable, and I encourage you to continue sharing your thoughts with us. Together, we can make the Fabric Adoption Framework a resource that truly serves you.
