Hello everyone! August has brought some exciting updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework website, and I can’t wait to share them with you. We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation to make it more accessible and user-friendly. One of the highlights is the addition of a dedicated License section, which you can now easily find in our navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage terms but also helps foster transparency in our community (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to streamline your experience, we’ve also collapsed the sidebar categories for better clarity. This should make it easier for you to navigate through our resources without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips (Read more ›).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we removed the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision stems from our desire to streamline the content and make it easier for you to find the information you truly need without sifting through updates that may not be relevant to your current journey. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that changes like this can feel a bit unsettling at first, but I genuinely believe this will lead to a more cohesive navigation experience. By focusing on the core content, we aim to make it simpler for you to access the resources that matter most. Thank you to everyone in our community who contributed their thoughts and feedback, helping us refine our approach. Your voices are invaluable in shaping the direction of our documentation.

As we move forward, I hope these adjustments will empower you to engage more deeply with the framework. We’re excited about the positive impact this will have on your journey, and we look forward to hearing how these changes serve you better.
