# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates we’ve made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We’ve been hard at work syncing new content and enhancing our documentation to better serve you. One of the key highlights is the addition of a License section, which you can now easily find in our navigation menu. This change not only clarifies how you can use our resources but also reflects our commitment to transparency and accessibility (Read more ›).

Additionally, we’ve made strides in improving the overall structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories, we’ve aimed to make navigation clearer and more intuitive for you. I truly believe these changes will help you find the information you need more quickly and efficiently (Read more ›). We’ve also updated our strategy category visibility, ensuring that our published strategies for Fabric adoption are more prominent, which I hope will inspire you on your journey (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable, and they drive us to continually improve. Together, we’re creating a more welcoming and user-friendly experience for everyone. I can’t wait to see how these updates impact your experience!

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework! I’m thrilled to share that we’ve laid down the initial content for our adoption framework, which is now available for you to explore. This foundational step is crucial as it sets the stage for how we guide our community in adopting best practices and utilizing the framework effectively. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to introducing new content, we’ve also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer aligned with our vision. This streamlining is important because it helps to clarify our messaging and ensures that you have access to the most relevant and useful information.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you have a more cohesive experience while navigating through our resources. By focusing on the most relevant information, we hope to make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through multiple updates. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

We believe that this adjustment will enhance your overall experience with our documentation. By consolidating our updates, we aim to provide you with a clearer path to understanding the Fabric Adoption Framework and its resources. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more enjoyable, and we’re excited to see how this impacts your engagement with our content. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed their thoughts and feedback during this process!

As we continue to evolve and improve our documentation, we’re committed to keeping your needs at the forefront. We hope these changes resonate with you and help you feel more connected to the information you seek. Thank you for being part of our journey!
