## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the wonderful changes that have taken place. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and apply the framework in your own work (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our community’s needs. This cleanup is essential as it helps ensure that you’re only seeing the most relevant and helpful information, allowing for a smoother reading experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. This decision stemmed from our desire to streamline your experience and ensure that the most relevant information is easily accessible without clutter. By simplifying our navigation, we hope to make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through updates that may not be as pertinent to your journey. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I genuinely believe that this shift will enhance your overall experience on our site. With fewer distractions, you can focus on the core content that truly matters to you. Our goal is to create a more intuitive pathway for you to navigate the resources we offer, allowing you to dive deeper into the topics that resonate with your needs. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the contributors and the community for their input and support in this transition. Your feedback is invaluable, and it helps us grow together.

As we continue to evolve, I’m excited about the potential impact these changes will have on our readers. We’re committed to making our documentation a welcoming and effective resource for everyone. I hope you find the new structure helpful and engaging as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework.
