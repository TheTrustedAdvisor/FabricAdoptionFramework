## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant shift in how we present our updates by removing the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While this might seem like a big change, it’s all about streamlining your experience and making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on more integrated updates throughout our documentation, we hope to create a smoother journey for you as you navigate the Fabric Adoption Framework. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision reflects our commitment to continuous improvement based on your feedback. We believe that by eliminating the standalone "What's New" section, we can enhance the flow of information and ensure that you’re always in the loop without the need to search through separate updates. It’s our way of saying that we value your time and want to make your experience as seamless as possible. For more details on this transition, check out the full explanation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this change. Your insights are invaluable, and together, we’re making the Fabric Adoption Framework a more user-friendly space. I’m excited to see how these updates will positively impact your experience as you engage with our content.
