# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some wonderful updates that enhance our documentation experience. We’ve synchronized new content and improved the overall structure, making it easier for you to navigate and find the information you need. Notably, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy categories in the documentation, which means you can now explore our strategies with greater ease and clarity (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c741c0df7564954cd2fd203e9fcb7d50b956.md).

One of the significant changes this month is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a link in the navigation menu. This addition is crucial as it ensures that you have easy access to the licensing information you need, fostering transparency and trust in our framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors who have worked diligently to bring these updates to life. Your efforts truly make a difference!

Lastly, we’ve made some adjustments to the sidebar categories for better clarity, which should help streamline your browsing experience. We believe that these thoughtful changes will not only make our documentation more user-friendly but also empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by introducing initial content that aims to guide you through your journey with us. You can find this new content in the [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md), which I hope will serve as a helpful starting point.

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup allows us to focus on delivering clear and concise information that truly matters to you. I believe that these changes will make navigation smoother and help you find what you need more quickly. For details on this, check out the [removal of initial documentation files for the framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your input and support are invaluable as we work together to create a more user-friendly experience. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes will positively impact your engagement with the framework. Let’s keep moving forward together!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. This month, we made a significant decision to streamline our content by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this may seem like a big change, we felt it was important to focus on providing you with the most relevant and accessible information without clutter. This change will help you navigate our resources more easily and find what you need without sifting through outdated updates. If you’re curious about the specifics, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This update matters because it reflects our commitment to continuous improvement and responsiveness to your feedback. By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to create a more intuitive experience that allows you to engage with our content more effectively. We believe this will encourage deeper exploration of the resources we offer, ultimately supporting your journey in adopting the Fabric framework. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and shared their insights with us.

As we move forward, I hope you find the new layout refreshing and easier to navigate. Your experience is at the heart of what we do, and we’re always looking for ways to enhance it. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Together, we can continue to make this a valuable resource for everyone involved.
