# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation to better serve you. One of the highlights is the addition of a License section, which now has its own link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also makes it easier for you to find important information regarding our content (Read more ›).

We also took a closer look at our documentation structure. By collapsing some sidebar categories, we aimed to improve clarity and streamline your navigation experience. I hope this makes it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we synchronized and expanded our strategy category visibility, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date strategies for Fabric adoption. These enhancements reflect our commitment to making your journey smoother and more intuitive.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support. Your feedback helps us create a better resource for everyone, and I’m thrilled to see these changes come to life. I can’t wait to hear how these updates impact your experience!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out a significant amount of initial content for the adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for a more structured approach to embracing our offerings. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining effort is all about making your navigation smoother and ensuring that you have access to the most pertinent information. It’s important for us to keep our resources relevant and user-friendly, and I hope you find these changes beneficial as you explore the framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While this section has served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made with you in mind. By removing the "What's New" section, we aim to declutter our navigation and allow you to focus on the core resources that support your journey with the framework. We believe this will help you find what you need more quickly and efficiently, making your experience smoother and more enjoyable. 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which guided us in making these changes. Your input is invaluable, and I’m excited to see how these updates will positively impact your experience with our documentation. Together, we’re building something great!
