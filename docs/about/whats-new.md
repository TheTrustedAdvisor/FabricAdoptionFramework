Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful updates we've made to enhance your experience.

This means that you can now access fresh strategies that are more aligned with current practices, making it easier for you to navigate your adoption journey.

In our efforts to improve clarity, we've made some thoughtful adjustments to the structure of our documentation. Notably, we've collapsed sidebar categories to streamline navigation, allowing you to find what you need more intuitively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we've added a License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible from the navigation menu (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made significant strides by adding initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding its purpose and how it can benefit you. You can dive into this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

These changes matter because they not only clarify the framework's objectives but also provide you with practical guidance on how to effectively adopt and implement it. We’ve also removed some outdated documentation to streamline your journey, ensuring that you're only seeing the most relevant and useful information. This cleanup helps us present a clearer narrative and a more user-friendly experience, which we hope will make your navigation through the materials smoother and more intuitive (Read more ›) [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input has been invaluable in shaping this framework and ensuring it meets your needs. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates will impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some updates from June that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant decision to streamline our content by removing the "What's New" documentation section. This change was made with the intention of decluttering our navigation and making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this decision [here](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30).

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. We want you to focus on the core content that supports your journey with the framework rather than sifting through updates that may not be relevant to your needs. Our hope is that this will lead to a smoother navigation experience and help you find what you’re looking for more quickly.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights have been invaluable in guiding these changes, and I’m excited to see how they positively impact your experience. Together, we’re making the documentation a better resource for everyone. (Read more ›)
