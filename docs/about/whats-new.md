# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful updates we've made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now also features a direct link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also makes it easier for you to find important information at a glance (Read more ›).

We've also worked hard to streamline our content and improve navigation. You might notice that we've collapsed some sidebar categories for clarity, making it simpler for you to explore our resources without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, we've synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information as you navigate your adoption journey (Read more ›). 

These updates are all about making your experience smoother and more intuitive. I hope you find these changes helpful as you dive into our documentation. A huge thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to these improvements! Your feedback and support mean the world to us.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the foundational content for our adoption framework. We’ve introduced an overview that outlines the framework's purpose and goals, making it easier for you to navigate and understand how to effectively use it in your projects (Read more ›).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup not only declutters the site but also allows you to focus on the most pertinent information. I hope these changes will provide a clearer path as you explore the framework and its applications. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this effort; your insights and hard work truly make a difference (Read more ›).

As we continue to grow and refine our resources, I’m optimistic that these updates will empower you on your adoption journey. I can’t wait to see how you apply the framework in your work! If you’re curious about the details of these changes, feel free to dive deeper into the [full list of updates](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-07-01&until=2025-07-31).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made after careful consideration and feedback from our community, as we aim to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without unnecessary clutter (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that changes like this can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I truly believe this will help us focus on delivering the most relevant and up-to-date content directly within our main documentation pages. By integrating updates into the sections where they matter most, we hope to create a more cohesive and engaging experience for you. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this discussion; your input is invaluable to us as we strive to improve our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how this change will foster a more intuitive navigation experience for all of you. We are committed to continuously refining our documentation to better serve your needs, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts on this new direction. Together, we’ll keep evolving and making our community stronger! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md)
