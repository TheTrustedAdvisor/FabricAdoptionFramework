## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even better. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it might feel a bit bittersweet, this decision was made to streamline our content and enhance navigation throughout the site. You can read more about this change [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By consolidating our documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive experience for you. This means you’ll be able to find the information you need more easily, without sifting through multiple sections. We believe that this will not only save you time but also help you engage more deeply with the content that truly matters to you.
