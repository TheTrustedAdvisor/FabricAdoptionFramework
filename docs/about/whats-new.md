# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some significant updates that enhance your experience on our site. We’ve synchronized new content, ensuring that our documentation is not only up-to-date but also reflective of the latest strategies for Fabric adoption (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-29aca670872315962827412318cbc8e797896e58.md). This means you can find the most relevant and practical information to guide your journey, all in one place.

We’ve also made some structural changes that I believe will improve your navigation experience. The sidebar categories have been collapsed for clarity, making it easier to find what you’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, along with a link in the navigation menu, so you can easily access this important information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

These updates matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with a seamless and informative experience as you navigate the world of Fabric adoption. I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these changes possible. Together, we’re building a resource that I hope will empower you on your journey.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some meaningful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework, which is now more accessible and structured than ever. We’ve introduced an overview that clearly outlines what the framework entails and how it can benefit you as you navigate your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having a well-defined framework is crucial for guiding you through the adoption process, ensuring that you have the resources and support you need. We’ve also removed some initial documentation that was no longer relevant, allowing us to streamline the information and focus on what truly matters (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This clarity will help you find what you need faster and with less confusion.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their invaluable feedback and support throughout this process. Together, we’re creating a more user-friendly experience that I hope will empower you on your journey. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience with the framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month has brought some significant changes to our documentation that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to streamline our content by removing the "What's New" section entirely. This decision was made to enhance the overall navigation experience and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on more relevant sections, we hope to create a smoother journey through our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change is important because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a clearer, more concise documentation experience. With fewer distractions, you can now focus on the core content that supports your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. I truly appreciate the community's feedback that guided us in making this decision, and I hope you find the updated structure more intuitive and user-friendly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I’m optimistic that these adjustments will foster a better understanding of our framework and its applications.
