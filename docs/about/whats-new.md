# What's new

## August 2025

August has brought some exciting updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework that I’m thrilled to share with you. We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, making it easier for you to navigate and find the information you need. For instance, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category within the docs, which means you can now access important strategies for Fabric adoption more intuitively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c741c0df7564954cd2fd203e9fcb7d50b956.md). Additionally, we’ve streamlined our sidebar by collapsing categories for clarity, ensuring a smoother browsing experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

We also took the time to refresh our content with the synchronization of new strategy methodology documents and the addition of a License section to our documentation (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md) (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). These updates not only reflect our commitment to providing you with the most relevant information but also enhance the overall governance of our documentation. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who have worked tirelessly to bring these changes to life.

As we continue to evolve, I hope these improvements make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enjoyable and productive. Your feedback is invaluable, and I look forward to hearing how these updates impact your experience.

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve taken significant steps by adding initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively embrace and implement our practices. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup not only declutters our resources but also makes it easier for you to find the information you need. I hope this makes your navigation smoother and more intuitive. You can read more about these changes [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these updates possible. Your feedback and involvement are invaluable as we continue to refine our framework. I’m looking forward to seeing how these enhancements will support you in your adoption journey. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even better. This month, we made the significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small change, we believe it will streamline the way you access information and keep our content focused and relevant. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment matters because it helps us create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. By eliminating redundant sections, we can direct your attention to the most valuable content without distractions. We hope this change will enhance your journey through our documentation, making it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated information. A heartfelt thank you to our contributors for their insights and feedback that guided this decision!

As we move forward, we expect this shift to foster a more intuitive experience for all users. It’s all about making your interaction with our documentation as seamless as possible. I’m looking forward to hearing how these changes resonate with you!
