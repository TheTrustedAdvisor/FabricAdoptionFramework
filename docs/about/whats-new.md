# What's new

## August 2025

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made some significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation to make it easier for you to find the information you need. For instance, we've added a new License section to our documentation and integrated a License link into the navigation menu, ensuring you have quick access to important legal information (Read more ›). 

In addition to these updates, we've synchronized our strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy categories within the docs. This means you’ll have a clearer understanding of our methodologies and how they can support your adoption journey (Read more ›). We’ve also taken steps to streamline our sidebar categories for better clarity, making it easier to navigate through the content (Read more ›). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for your continued support and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these improvements.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enriching. This month, we have laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. You can explore this foundational information in our new overview, which is designed to guide you through the framework's objectives and how it can benefit your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to the new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated files that no longer serve our community's needs. This cleanup not only helps in decluttering our resources but also ensures that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I believe these changes will allow you to navigate our documentation with greater ease and clarity.

A heartfelt thank you goes out to all contributors who have worked tirelessly to bring these updates to life. Your efforts are truly appreciated, and I hope these enhancements will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made the significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it might seem like a small change, it reflects our commitment to streamline our content and ensure that you can easily navigate the resources that matter most to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By consolidating our documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. We want you to find the information you need without sifting through sections that may no longer serve a purpose. This change is a step towards making our documentation more intuitive and focused, allowing you to dive straight into the content that will help you on your journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have guided these updates. Your feedback is invaluable, and we’re hopeful that these adjustments will foster a more engaging and efficient experience for everyone involved. Together, we’re creating a space that reflects our shared goals and aspirations (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md).
