Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that are sure to enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in improving our documentation structure and content.

One of the most notable changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which provides clarity and transparency about how you can use our materials (Read more ›). We’ve also made it simpler to access this information by adding a License link directly to our navigation menu (Read more ›). These updates matter because they help create a more user-friendly environment, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: successfully adopting the Fabric framework.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and collaboration.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this section has served us well, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without any clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment is important because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a more intuitive navigation experience. By simplifying our documentation, we hope to help you focus on the content that matters most. I truly believe that this will lead to a more seamless journey as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision and helped us refine our approach!

As we move forward, I am excited about the impact this change will have on your experience with our documentation. I hope you find it easier to navigate and discover valuable insights. Your feedback is always welcome, and I look forward to hearing how these changes resonate with you.
