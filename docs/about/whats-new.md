## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation to better serve you. We’ve added a new License section to our documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu, making it easier for you to find important information about our usage policies (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md) (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of integrating Fabric into your projects. You can explore the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also took the opportunity to tidy up our resources by removing some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This decluttering helps streamline your navigation and ensures you have access to the most pertinent information. You can read more about these changes [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This change was made to streamline our content and focus on the most relevant information for you. By consolidating updates and information, we hope to make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through numerous sections. If you're curious about the specifics, you can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, our goal is to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. By removing redundant sections, we can better highlight the content that truly matters in your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We want you to spend less time searching and more time learning and applying what you discover. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improve our documentation based on your feedback and needs.

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and community members who have provided insights and suggestions that led to this improvement. Your input is invaluable, and it truly helps us shape a better experience for everyone. As we move forward, I’m excited about the positive impact these changes will have on your engagement with our documentation.
