# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some fresh updates from the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We’ve been busy enhancing your experience with our documentation, making it clearer and more accessible. One of the key changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a new License link in the navigation menu. This addition is important because it helps you easily understand the terms under which you can use our materials (Read more ›). 

We’ve also streamlined the sidebar by collapsing categories for better clarity, allowing you to navigate through our resources more intuitively. This change aims to reduce clutter and help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and the community for your invaluable input and support. Your engagement helps us continuously improve and adapt to your needs. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes impact your journey with us!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. This foundational information is crucial as it helps you understand how to effectively implement the framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some important decisions about our documentation. We removed several initial files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that our resources are streamlined and focused on what truly matters for you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This clarity will help you navigate through the documentation with ease and find the information you need without the clutter.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors for their hard work and dedication in bringing these changes to life. Your efforts make a significant difference in how we communicate and support our community.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section entirely. While it may seem like a big shift, the goal is to streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may not be relevant to your journey. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment matters because it reflects our commitment to enhancing user experience. By simplifying our navigation, we hope to create a more intuitive path for you to follow as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework. We believe that focusing on the core content will help you engage with the material more effectively and find the guidance you seek with greater ease. 

As always, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. It's your insights that help us evolve and improve. I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience with our documentation!
