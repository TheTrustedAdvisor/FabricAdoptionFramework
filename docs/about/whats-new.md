In our continuous effort to streamline navigation, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, making it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we’ve introduced a License section and linked it directly in the navigation menu, ensuring that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). 

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, concise, and relevant information as you adopt our framework. We believe that a well-structured and easily navigable site will empower you to make the most of the resources we offer. Thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your input is invaluable to our community. I hope you enjoy exploring the new content and structure! (531 commits)

## July 2025

Hello dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in our documentation by introducing the initial content for the adoption framework. You’ll find a comprehensive overview that lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively adopt our framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). 

These changes matter because they provide you with a clearer pathway to navigate the adoption process. By establishing this foundational content, we aim to empower you with the knowledge and resources needed to integrate the framework seamlessly into your workflows. I truly believe this will foster a more collaborative and informed community around our project. 

Additionally, we’ve streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our readers (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This cleanup helps ensure that you have access to the most relevant and useful information. A heartfelt thank you to all contributors who have helped bring this vision to life. Your efforts are deeply appreciated! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant decision to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While it may seem like a small change, it’s part of our effort to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

The reasoning behind this update is simple: we want to eliminate redundancy and ensure that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information without sifting through sections that may no longer serve your needs. By focusing on clarity and conciseness, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. This change is a testament to the feedback we’ve received from our community, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed their thoughts and ideas.

As we move forward, I anticipate that this adjustment will allow you to engage more seamlessly with our documentation. It’s all about creating a user-friendly environment where you can find what you need without any hassle. I’m looking forward to hearing how these changes impact your journey with us!
