## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made significant strides in our content and navigation, ensuring that you can find what you need more intuitively. One of the highlights is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which you can now easily access through a dedicated link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage terms but also fosters transparency within our community (Read more ›).

These updates are all about making your journey smoother and more informative, so you can focus on what truly matters—your adoption process (Read more ›).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by introducing the initial content for our adoption framework. This new section is designed to provide you with a comprehensive overview and guidance on how to effectively adopt and integrate our framework into your projects. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md).

In addition to the new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup not only helps in decluttering our resources but also ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated material. You can read more about these changes [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This change was made to streamline our content and improve your navigation experience, allowing you to focus more on the resources that truly matter to you. If you’re curious about the specifics of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we hope to enhance your journey as you explore the framework. We believe that a more cohesive and straightforward layout will help you find the information you need quickly and efficiently. This is all about making your experience smoother and more enjoyable, so you can focus on what you do best.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our community and contributors for their valuable input and support during this transition. Your feedback is what drives us to continuously improve. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your use of the framework.
