# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content and improving navigation. For instance, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity, allowing you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

This is a crucial step in making our resources more accessible and user-friendly.

In addition to this, we’ve also introduced an overview of the Fabric Adoption Framework, providing you with a clear roadmap of what to expect as you navigate through our documentation (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant change to our documentation structure that I want to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. This decision was not made lightly, but we believe it will help streamline your experience, allowing you to focus more on the content that truly matters to you. By consolidating our updates into other sections, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change is important because it reflects our commitment to improving how you access information. We want to ensure that you're not overwhelmed by multiple sections but rather guided smoothly through the resources available. With this more integrated approach, we anticipate that you’ll find it easier to stay informed about the latest developments and best practices in the Fabric Adoption Framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I’d like to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision. Your feedback and support are invaluable to us. We’re excited to see how this change enhances your experience on our site, and we look forward to continuing this journey together.
