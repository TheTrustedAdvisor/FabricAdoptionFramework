## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which is a significant step forward in providing you with the guidance and resources you need. You can explore this foundational material in detail here: [Initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also made some important adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current direction. This streamlining helps ensure that you have access to only the most relevant and useful information. If you're interested in the specifics of these removals, you can read about them here: [Remove initial documentation on Fabric Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to improving your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment matters because it allows us to declutter the navigation and make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated updates. By refining our content structure, we hope to enhance your journey through the documentation, making it more intuitive and user-friendly. I truly believe that this will lead to a more enjoyable experience as you explore our resources. 

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors and the community for their feedback and support in this process. Your insights are invaluable, and they help us create a better resource for everyone. Together, we’re shaping a more cohesive and accessible framework. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience!
