## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enriching. This month, we made significant strides in enhancing our documentation and navigation. For instance, we've added a new License section to our documentation, along with a convenient link in the navigation menu, ensuring you can easily access this important information (Read more ›). We also synchronized our strategy methodology documents, which means you now have the latest insights at your fingertips (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to improve clarity, we collapsed some sidebar categories. This change is designed to streamline your navigation experience, making it easier to find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we updated the label for the Trusted Advisor link to better reflect its purpose, helping you navigate our resources more intuitively (Read more ›). These changes matter because they enhance your ability to engage with our content and support your journey in adopting Fabric.

As always, I want to express my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community members who helped bring these updates to life.

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid down the initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a guiding light for our community. This foundational work is crucial because it provides you with a clear understanding of how to effectively adopt and integrate our framework into your projects. You can dive into the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated documentation related to the Fabric Framework. This streamlining helps ensure that you’re not wading through irrelevant information and can focus on what truly matters. I appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these improvements possible, allowing us to present a cleaner, more coherent resource for everyone.

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation more user-friendly and intuitive. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this may seem like a big step, it was done to streamline our content and focus more on the essential information you need without any clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to enhance your experience as you navigate through our documentation. This change allows us to integrate updates directly into the relevant sections, ensuring that you have the most current information at your fingertips without having to search through separate updates. We believe this will make your journey through our resources smoother and more cohesive. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their feedback and support throughout this process. Your insights are invaluable in helping us create a more effective documentation experience. We’re excited about the impact these changes will have, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts as you explore the updated content!
