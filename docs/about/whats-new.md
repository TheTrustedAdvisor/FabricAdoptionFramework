# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a month of refreshing changes for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share what’s new with you. We’ve made some significant updates to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. For starters, we’ve synchronized new content from our development repository, ensuring that you have access to the latest insights and strategies (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-20ad6f8e9e3390d7f7b7f8b3419af046bbffa507.md). This means you can dive into the most relevant information without sifting through outdated materials.

In our efforts to improve navigation, we’ve added a License section to the documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md). This change is all about transparency and making it easier for you to understand the terms under which our resources are shared. Additionally, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, helping you find what you need more efficiently (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors for their hard work and dedication in making these updates possible. Your efforts truly make a difference in creating a welcoming and informative space for everyone. I hope you find these changes beneficial as you navigate the framework, and I look forward to seeing how they enhance your journey with us!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps toward establishing a solid foundation for our documentation. We added initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a clearer understanding of its purpose and how it can benefit you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This is a big leap in making our resources more accessible and user-friendly.

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This helps to streamline our resources and ensures that you only see information that is current and useful (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). By decluttering our documentation, we aim to create a smoother navigation experience, allowing you to find what you need more quickly.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a resource that truly serves our community. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates will help you in your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we are building something special!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation that I want to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While it served its purpose, we felt that it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. This change allows us to focus on providing you with the most relevant and valuable resources without the clutter of redundant updates (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this shift will enhance your experience as you navigate our documentation. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment that directs your attention to the core content you need. It’s all about making your journey with us smoother and more enjoyable! I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community for your continued support and feedback, which helps us grow and improve (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience with our documentation. Together, we’re building a space that truly reflects your needs and preferences. Let’s keep this momentum going!
