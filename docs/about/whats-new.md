One of the most significant changes is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By decluttering our navigation, we aim to enhance your experience and help you focus on the resources that are most relevant to your journey with us (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our structure, we hope to create a more intuitive experience that allows you to engage with the content without unnecessary distractions.
