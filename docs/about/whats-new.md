# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for us, and I’m excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the significant changes is the addition of a new License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu. This update not only clarifies the usage rights but also fosters transparency, making it easier for you to understand how to engage with our resources (Read more ›).

We’ve also made strides in organizing our content. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we aim to streamline your navigation experience, allowing you to find what you need more intuitively. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips (Read more ›). These changes are all about making your journey smoother and more enjoyable as you explore the framework.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community members who have helped us refine our documentation. Your feedback and support are invaluable, and we look forward to continuing this journey together. Let’s keep pushing forward!

In addition to the new content, we’ve made some important adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation that no longer serves our community’s needs. This streamlining is crucial, as it ensures that you have access to the most relevant information without the clutter of old files (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes that I believe will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This was a tough decision, but we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and essential information. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, by simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated or redundant sections. We want to ensure that your journey through our resources is as smooth and intuitive as possible. The impact of this change should lead to a more cohesive experience, allowing you to focus on adopting the framework effectively. A heartfelt thank you to our contributors for their insights and feedback that helped guide this decision!

As we move forward, I hope these adjustments will make your time on the site more enjoyable and productive. We're committed to continuously improving our documentation based on your needs and suggestions, so please don’t hesitate to reach out with your thoughts. Together, we can make this a fantastic resource for everyone involved in the Fabric Adoption Framework.
