## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some meaningful updates we’ve made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We’ve been hard at work syncing new content and enhancing our documentation to better serve you. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section, which you can now find in our navigation menu. This is an important step in ensuring transparency and clarity around the usage of our resources (Read more ›).

We’ve also streamlined the way you navigate our documentation by collapsing sidebar categories for better clarity. This should make it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed by options. Additionally, we’ve updated our strategy methodology documents and expanded their visibility, making it simpler for you to access valuable insights for your adoption journey (Read more ›).

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

This cleanup allows for a more focused and user-friendly experience, ensuring that you can find the most relevant information without sifting through unnecessary details (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant change to our documentation structure that I want to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our website. This decision was made with your experience in mind, as we aim to streamline the information you receive and make it easier for you to find what truly matters. By focusing on more integrated updates throughout the documentation, we believe you’ll have a smoother navigation experience. If you want to dive deeper into this change, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a cleaner and more cohesive documentation experience. Instead of a separate section for updates, we want you to discover new information naturally as you explore the content. We believe this will enhance your understanding and engagement with the material, making it feel more connected and relevant to your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. For more details on this update, feel free to check out the full explanation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and community for their continuous support and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these changes. Your input drives us to create a better experience for everyone. I’m excited about the positive impact these updates will have on our readers, and I can’t wait to see how you all engage with the refreshed content!
