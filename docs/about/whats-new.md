# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a month of exciting updates for the Fabric Adoption Framework! We’ve been hard at work refining our documentation to make it even more user-friendly and accessible. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section, which can now be found in our navigation menu. This addition is crucial as it clarifies the terms under which our content can be used, fostering transparency and trust within our community (Read more ›).

We also took the opportunity to enhance our strategy category visibility in the documentation. This means that you can now easily find the strategies that best suit your adoption journey, helping you navigate the resources more effectively. Additionally, we’ve synchronized and expanded our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the latest insights at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

Lastly, we’ve made some adjustments to our sidebar categories for clarity and removed an outdated article on assessing your Fabric adoption strategy. These changes not only streamline your experience but also reflect our commitment to providing you with the most relevant and helpful content. Thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your input is invaluable in shaping our community. I’m excited for you to explore the new and improved documentation!

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps in establishing the foundation of our documentation. We added initial content that outlines the adoption framework, which serves as a guiding light for anyone looking to navigate this journey with us. You can check out the details of this addition in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we made the decision to streamline our resources by removing some of the initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to ensure that you have access to only the most pertinent and useful information as you explore the framework. I truly believe that these changes will make it easier for you to find what you need and feel more confident in your adoption journey. For more about this, you can read about the [removal of initial documentation](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable, and I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact our community. Together, we’re making strides toward a more accessible and user-friendly experience!

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation by removing the "What's New" section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, it reflects our ongoing commitment to streamline your experience and ensure that the most relevant information is easily accessible. By consolidating updates into more integrated sections, we aim to enhance clarity and navigation throughout the site. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe this update matters because it allows us to focus on the content that truly impacts you, our valued readers. It’s all about making your journey through our documentation smoother and more intuitive. By eliminating redundancy, we hope to create a more cohesive narrative that guides you effortlessly to the information you need. Thank you for your continued support and feedback, which inspires these improvements every day!

As we move forward, we expect this change to foster a more engaging and user-friendly experience. Your insights are invaluable, and I encourage you to share your thoughts on how we can keep evolving together. Let’s make this documentation a place where you feel at home and empowered to adopt our framework with confidence.
