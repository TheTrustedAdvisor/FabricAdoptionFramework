# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates we've made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We've been busy refining our content and structure to make your experience even smoother. One of the key changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which you can now easily find in the navigation menu. This addition not only clarifies the usage rights but also enhances transparency, making it easier for you to understand how to engage with our materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We've also streamlined our documentation by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, ensuring that you can find what you need without any fuss. This change reflects our commitment to providing a user-friendly experience, allowing you to navigate through the wealth of information with ease (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm thrilled to share some of the meaningful changes we've made to enhance your experience. We've introduced initial content for the Adoption Framework, which lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively integrate Fabric into your projects. This new content aims to provide clarity and guidance, making it easier for you to navigate the adoption process and find the resources you need (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-ef171291424f34aa6a56efad5d457a81d3302a54.md).

In addition to this, we've streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup not only simplifies navigation but also ensures that you're greeted with the most pertinent information right from the start. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more intuitive as you explore what Fabric has to offer (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights help us shape the framework into a resource that truly meets your needs. I’m excited about the impact these changes will have and look forward to seeing how they assist you in your adoption journey. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change that I believe will enhance your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the most relevant information without sifting through updates that may no longer serve you. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By removing this section, we aim to create a cleaner, more focused navigation experience. We understand that your time is precious, and we want to ensure that you can access the information you need without unnecessary distractions. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improving our documentation and making it more user-friendly. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback, which have been invaluable in guiding these decisions.

We anticipate that this shift will have a positive impact on how you interact with our resources, allowing you to dive straight into the content that matters most to you. As we continue to evolve, your insights will always be at the forefront of our efforts. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!
