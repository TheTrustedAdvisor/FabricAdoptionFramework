# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our content and navigation. You’ll find that we’ve synchronized new content for the framework, which not only enriches our documentation but also ensures that you have the most up-to-date information at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-29aca670872315962827412318cbc8e797896e58.md). Additionally, we’ve added a License section to our documentation and included a direct link in the navigation menu, making it easier for you to access important legal information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md) (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md).

Why does this matter? Well, clarity and accessibility are at the heart of what we do. By collapsing sidebar categories, we've made it easier for you to navigate through our resources without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). We also removed the "Assess your Fabric adoption strategy" article to streamline our content, ensuring that you can focus on the most relevant information without any distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-86abc0ed4dd4a81452b0f5d39d1cce1f0513365e.md). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which truly makes a difference. I’m hopeful that these improvements will enhance your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework and empower you to make the most of our resources. Together, we’re creating a more user-friendly environment, and I can't wait to see how you all benefit from these changes! (531 commits)

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by introducing initial content that aims to guide you through the process of integrating Fabric into your projects. You can explore this foundational content in our new documentation section, which is designed to be user-friendly and informative (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some important housekeeping changes by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our purpose. This streamlining helps ensure that you receive the most relevant information without the clutter of unnecessary materials (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). These updates matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, concise, and actionable guidance as you navigate your adoption journey.

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your insights and efforts are invaluable to our community, and I’m confident that these updates will make a positive impact on your experience. I can’t wait to see how you all utilize this new framework in your projects! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md) (115 commits)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I hope this message finds you well. This month, we made a significant change that I want to share with you. We have decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section from our website. This decision was made after careful consideration of how we can streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need. You can read more about this change in detail here: [Read more ›](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By removing this section, we aim to declutter the navigation and focus on providing you with the most relevant and up-to-date information right where you need it. We believe this will enhance your overall experience and make it simpler for you to engage with our documentation. We truly appreciate your feedback and support as we continue to refine our approach to better serve you.

As we move forward, we expect this change to foster a more intuitive navigation experience, allowing you to find what you're looking for without unnecessary distractions. Thank you for being part of our community and for your continued engagement. Your input helps us grow, and we’re excited about the journey ahead!
