This decision came after careful consideration of how we can enhance your navigation experience and keep our documentation concise and user-friendly (Read more ›).

I believe this change matters because it allows us to create a more cohesive structure, making it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through multiple sections. We aim to provide clarity and direct access to the most pertinent updates and resources, which we hope will positively impact your journey with our framework. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who shared their thoughts on how we can improve. Your feedback is invaluable to us (Read more ›).
