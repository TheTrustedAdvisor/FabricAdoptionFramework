# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a month of exciting updates for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share what’s new! We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, including the addition of a License section that clarifies the terms under which our content can be used. This change not only helps you understand your rights but also fosters a sense of trust and transparency in our community (Read more ›). 

We’ve also streamlined our navigation by adding a direct link to the License section, making it easier for you to find important information at a glance (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve worked on expanding the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation. This means that you’ll now have quicker access to the strategies that can guide your adoption process, ultimately making your journey smoother and more informed (Read more ›). 

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are invaluable, and together, we’re building a more user-friendly experience for all. I’m excited to see how these enhancements will impact your exploration of the Fabric Adoption Framework!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of embracing our tools and practices. You can explore the details of this foundational work in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also took the opportunity to streamline our resources by removing some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps ensure that you have access to only the most pertinent information, making your journey smoother and more intuitive. I truly believe that these changes will foster a clearer understanding of our framework and its benefits, allowing you to focus on what matters most. 

A heartfelt thank you goes out to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and collaboration. Your feedback and insights are invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve you. I can't wait to see how these updates will empower you in your adoption journey!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. After careful consideration and feedback from our community, we decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This change allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and useful information without redundancy. You can read more about this decision [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, by eliminating this section, we can enhance the overall navigation experience and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. Our goal is to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment that helps you engage with the content more effectively. I genuinely believe this will have a positive impact on your experience as you explore our documentation.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who provided feedback and insights that led to this change. Your voices are invaluable, and I’m thrilled to see how these adjustments will help us grow together. If you’d like to dive deeper into the specifics of these updates, feel free to check out the detailed changes [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md). Together, we’re making strides toward a more intuitive and welcoming documentation space. (19 commits)
