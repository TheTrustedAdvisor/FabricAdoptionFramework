# What's new

## August 2025

Hello dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made several important changes to our documentation that I think you’ll find helpful. For starters, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, along with a convenient link in the navigation menu. This addition clarifies the usage rights for our content and ensures that you have easy access to this important information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

In our ongoing effort to make our resources clearer and more accessible, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for better navigation. This change is all about helping you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed by too many options (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

Your input drives these improvements, and I’m excited to see how these changes will empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Let’s continue to grow and learn together!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m thrilled to share some exciting updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve rolled out the initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational resource for anyone looking to navigate and implement our framework effectively. This is a significant step forward as it provides clarity and guidance, making it easier for you to find what you need (Read more ›).

We also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, streamlining our content to ensure you’re only seeing the most useful and up-to-date information. This cleanup not only simplifies navigation but also helps us maintain a clear focus on the resources that matter most to you (Read more ›). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their hard work and dedication in bringing these changes to life. 

As we continue to build and refine our documentation, I’m optimistic that these enhancements will foster a more intuitive and supportive environment for all users. Your feedback is invaluable, and I look forward to hearing how these updates impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re making strides toward a more cohesive and accessible resource!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we have decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision wasn't made lightly, but we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By eliminating this section, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. We want you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may no longer serve your journey. This shift allows us to concentrate on delivering high-quality content that truly matters to you. I appreciate the feedback from our community that has guided us toward this decision, and I am excited to see how it will positively impact your interactions with our documentation.

As we move forward, I hope these changes will make your experience smoother and more enjoyable. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your continued support. Together, we can make the Fabric Adoption Framework a valuable resource for everyone involved.
