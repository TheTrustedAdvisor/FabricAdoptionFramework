Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I can’t wait to share what’s new with you. We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, particularly with the introduction of the initial content for the adoption framework. This foundational material not only lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively adopt our framework but also provides a clearer path for those looking to integrate it into their projects. You can check out the details about this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also removed some outdated initial documentation that no longer aligns with our current direction. This streamlining is crucial as it helps eliminate confusion and ensures that you have access to the most relevant and useful information. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md) and [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed to these changes. Your input and support make a real difference in shaping our documentation to better serve you. I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates will empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building something great!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation more user-friendly and streamlined. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made to enhance the overall clarity and navigation experience for you, our valued users, as we aim to keep the focus on the most relevant and impactful content. If you’d like to dive deeper into the details of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe that this adjustment will help you find the information you need more efficiently, allowing you to concentrate on what matters most in your journey with us. By simplifying our structure, we hope to create a more seamless experience that encourages you to engage with our resources without unnecessary distractions. A heartfelt thank you goes out to our contributors who helped shape this decision and to our community for your ongoing feedback; it truly makes a difference.

As we continue to evolve, I’m optimistic that these changes will foster a more intuitive and enjoyable experience for everyone. Your insights are invaluable, and I encourage you to keep sharing your thoughts with us as we grow together. Let’s keep this momentum going!
