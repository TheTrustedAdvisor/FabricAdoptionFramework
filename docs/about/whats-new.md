## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made a significant change to our documentation that I want to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. This was a tough decision, but we believe it will help streamline your experience as you navigate our resources. By eliminating this section, we hope to make the content more cohesive and easier to follow, allowing you to focus on the information that truly matters to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will enhance your journey with us. By simplifying our structure, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience that allows you to find what you need without any distractions. It’s all about making your time spent with our documentation as productive and enjoyable as possible (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
