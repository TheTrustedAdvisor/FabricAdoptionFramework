This change is crucial because it streamlines your onboarding experience, making it easier to get started with the tools and strategies we offer.

In addition, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category and synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption. This means you’ll find it much simpler to navigate through our resources and access the information you need (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c74.md). I believe these enhancements will empower you to make informed decisions as you adopt Fabric in your projects.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm thrilled to share some exciting updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made significant strides by introducing initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a strong foundation for understanding and implementing the framework effectively. You can explore the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having clear and accessible documentation is crucial for you to navigate the adoption process smoothly. We also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that you have a streamlined and focused resource to guide you. These changes not only declutter our site but also help you find the information you need more efficiently. If you want to dive deeper into the removals, you can check out the specifics [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to thank all the contributors who have worked tirelessly to bring these updates to life. Your dedication is what makes this community so special. As we continue to build and refine our documentation, I hope these changes will empower you on your adoption journey. Together, we’re making great strides!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This change was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may no longer be relevant. You can read more about this decision [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe that this shift will help us focus on delivering the most pertinent information directly to you. By simplifying our navigation and structure, we hope to create a more intuitive experience that allows you to dive right into the content that matters most. This is all part of our ongoing commitment to ensure that our documentation remains user-friendly and accessible.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community for their feedback and support as we continue to evolve. Your insights are invaluable in shaping the future of our documentation. I’m excited about these changes and look forward to hearing how they impact your journey with us!
