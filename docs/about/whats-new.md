# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our documentation to make it easier for you to navigate. For instance, we collapsed the sidebar categories for clarity, which I hope will help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). 

In addition to this, we've introduced a new License section in our documentation, along with a link in the navigation menu. This addition is crucial as it ensures that you have easy access to important licensing information, fostering transparency and trust in our community (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). I want to take a moment to thank everyone involved in these changes; your contributions truly make a difference in how we serve our users.

Finally, we've also synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption and expanded the visibility of our strategy category within the documentation. This means you can now more easily access the resources that can guide you on your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-9993fe2ef400b1868a1874a379e6fe864b68fd0c.md).

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we have decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This change was made after careful consideration, as we want to streamline the information you receive and ensure that everything is as relevant and accessible as possible (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our structure, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. We understand that keeping track of changes can sometimes feel overwhelming, so we’re committed to making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. Our goal is to foster a more intuitive interaction with our resources, allowing you to focus on what you need without unnecessary distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
