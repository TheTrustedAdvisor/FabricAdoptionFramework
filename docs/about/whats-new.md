# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a bustling month for our Fabric Adoption Framework community, and I'm excited to share some of the updates that have come your way! We've made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, including the addition of a new License section, which you can now easily find in the navigation menu. This change is important as it provides clarity on how our content can be used, ensuring that everyone feels confident in their engagement with our resources (Read more ›). 

We've also taken steps to improve your navigation experience by collapsing sidebar categories for better clarity. This should make it easier for you to find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed by too many options at once (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our documentation with the latest strategy methodology documents, which means you now have access to the most current insights and practices for Fabric adoption (Read more ›).

Your feedback and involvement are what make this framework thrive, and I can’t wait to see how these changes will positively impact your journey with us.

## July 2025

July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the wonderful changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework with initial content that aims to guide you through the process of integrating our solutions into your projects. This new content is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it easier for you to understand the framework's benefits and how to leverage them effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated materials that no longer serve our community's needs. This decluttering helps ensure that the information you find is relevant and up-to-date, allowing you to focus on what truly matters (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md). I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this effort; your input has been invaluable in shaping a resource that truly reflects our community's needs.

As we move forward, I believe these changes will foster a more engaging and supportive environment for all users. I’m hopeful that the new framework will not only clarify the adoption process but also empower you to make informed decisions as you embark on your journey with us. Together, we’re building something special, and I can’t wait to see how you all utilize these new resources! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md)

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this section has served its purpose, we felt that it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through outdated updates. This change is aimed at creating a more cohesive and navigable resource for you. If you're curious about the specifics, you can read more about this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe that this adjustment will help us focus on delivering the most relevant and useful content directly to you. By simplifying our documentation, we hope to foster a more engaging and user-friendly experience. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and for your ongoing support as we continue to evolve our framework. Your feedback is invaluable, and it inspires us to keep improving. 

As we move forward, I’m excited to see how these changes will impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we can create a more intuitive and enriching experience for all.
