# What's new

## August 2025

August has brought some exciting updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework website, and I’m thrilled to share them with you! One of the most significant changes is the addition of a new License section in our documentation, which not only clarifies the usage rights but also enhances transparency for our users. You can find this new section in the navigation menu, making it easier than ever to access (Read more ›). 

We’ve also taken steps to streamline your experience by collapsing sidebar categories for better clarity. This change is designed to help you navigate our resources more intuitively, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—your journey with Fabric adoption. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date information right at your fingertips (Read more ›).

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve taken significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our framework documentation. We’ve added initial content that outlines the framework’s purpose and structure, making it easier for you to navigate and understand how to adopt it effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md). 

Why does this matter? Well, having clear and accessible documentation is crucial for anyone looking to implement the framework in their projects. It not only saves you time but also empowers you with the knowledge you need to make informed decisions. We’ve also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that what you see is streamlined and focused on what truly matters (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change that I want to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section from our site. This decision wasn’t made lightly, but we believe it will help streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on the most relevant resources, we hope to enhance your experience and make navigation more intuitive (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this adjustment will lead to a more cohesive and user-friendly environment. Our goal is to ensure that you can easily access the most pertinent information without sifting through sections that may no longer serve you. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision; your insights and feedback are invaluable to us (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I’m excited about the potential this change holds for enhancing our community’s experience. We hope that by simplifying our documentation, you’ll feel more empowered to dive into the resources that help you thrive. Thank you for being part of this journey with us!
