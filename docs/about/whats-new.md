## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that are sure to enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation by introducing the initial content for the adoption framework. This new content aims to guide you through the adoption process in a clear and accessible way, making it easier to understand and implement. You can dive into the details of this update [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps streamline our resources, allowing you to focus on the most pertinent information without the clutter of outdated materials. It’s all about making your journey smoother, and I believe these changes will have a positive impact on how you navigate our site.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section. We believe this adjustment will streamline your experience on the Fabric Adoption Framework website, allowing you to focus on the content that truly matters to you. By consolidating updates into our main documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive narrative that highlights the evolution of our framework without the distraction of separate updates. If you're curious about the specifics of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made with you in mind. We want to ensure that navigating our documentation feels intuitive and that you can easily find the information you need. By integrating updates directly into the relevant sections, we hope to enhance your understanding and engagement with our framework. I’d like to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community members who provided valuable feedback during this process. Your insights are what help us grow and improve!

As we move forward, I anticipate that this change will foster a more fluid reading experience, making it easier for you to stay informed about the latest developments. I’m excited to see how this new approach will resonate with you and enhance your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, let's continue to build a supportive and informative space!
