# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our content and navigation to better serve you. For instance, we’ve synchronized new content across the site, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, which not only clarifies usage rights but also enhances transparency for our community (Read more ›).

In our continued effort to improve usability, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, making it easier for you to navigate through the wealth of information we provide (Read more ›). We also updated the label for the Trusted Advisor link, ensuring that you can find the resources you need without any confusion (Read more ›). These changes matter because they create a more intuitive and user-friendly environment, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—adopting and implementing the Fabric framework effectively.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to all the contributors and the community for your ongoing support and feedback. Your insights drive these improvements, and I hope you enjoy exploring the updated documentation. Together, we’re building a robust foundation for successful Fabric adoption!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the meaningful changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This new documentation is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and utilize our framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter the site and ensures that you can focus on the most current and useful information. By refining our structure, we aim to create a more intuitive experience for you as you explore the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all the contributors and community members who have played a role in these updates. Your efforts are what make this documentation a valuable resource.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation as user-friendly and intuitive as possible. This month, we made the significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small change, it’s part of our effort to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without unnecessary clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This update matters because it allows us to focus on enhancing the overall navigation and structure of our documentation. By eliminating redundant sections, we aim to create a more cohesive experience for you, our valued readers. We believe that this will lead to a more straightforward path to the resources you seek, making your journey through our documentation smoother and more enjoyable. 

As always, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to our contributors and the community for your feedback and support. Your insights help us continually improve and adapt our documentation to better serve you. Let’s keep this momentum going together!
