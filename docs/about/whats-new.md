In addition to content synchronization, we’ve also added a License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible from the navigation menu. This change is essential as it clarifies the usage rights and responsibilities associated with our materials, fostering transparency and trust within our community (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made significant strides by introducing the initial content for the adoption framework, which serves as a foundational resource for everyone looking to navigate our offerings more effectively.

In addition to adding new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files related to the Fabric Framework. This cleanup helps to ensure that you have easy access to the most relevant and up-to-date information. By focusing on what truly matters, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience for all our readers.
