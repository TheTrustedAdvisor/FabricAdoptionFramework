## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that are designed to enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation and navigation, making it easier for you to find what you need. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a License section, which you can now find in our navigation menu. This clarity is essential for understanding how you can use our work (Read more ›) and we hope it will empower you to engage with our resources more confidently.

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our content, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity. This change aims to reduce clutter and help you focus on what truly matters. Additionally, we’ve synced new content from our development repository, ensuring that you have access to the latest strategies for Fabric adoption (Read more ›). These updates reflect our commitment to providing you with a user-friendly experience, and I genuinely believe they will make your exploration of the framework much more enjoyable.

Lastly, I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to all the contributors and community members who have helped us reach these milestones. Your input and support are invaluable, and together, we’re building something remarkable. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes impact your journey with us!

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we've taken significant steps to enrich our documentation and make it more accessible for you. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, providing a solid foundation that outlines our goals and approach. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand how to implement our framework effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

In addition to the new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our purpose. This decluttering helps ensure that you find the most relevant information without wading through unnecessary details (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made a significant change to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I want to share with you. We've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision stems from our commitment to streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through repetitive updates. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change matters because it allows us to focus on providing you with more valuable content and insights instead of just listing updates. By simplifying our structure, we hope to enhance your navigation experience and make it easier for you to engage with the materials that truly matter to you. This is all part of our ongoing effort to listen to your feedback and improve our documentation based on what you find most useful. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and community for their support and input throughout this process. Your voices help shape our documentation, and we are excited about the positive impact these changes will have on your journey with us.
