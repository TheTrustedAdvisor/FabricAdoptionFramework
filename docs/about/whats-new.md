Additionally, we’ve added a License section to our documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu. This change aims to provide clarity and transparency about the usage rights of our materials, which I know many of you have been looking for (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, we’ve made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. While this section has served us well, we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and useful information without redundancy (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. This change allows us to direct your attention to the core materials that truly support your journey with the framework. We believe that a cleaner, more focused layout will help you find the information you need more efficiently, ultimately making your experience smoother and more enjoyable (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
