# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a dedicated License section, which you can now easily find in our navigation menu. This update not only clarifies the terms under which our content is shared but also reflects our commitment to transparency and accessibility in our resources (Read more ›).

We’ve also made strides in organizing our content more effectively. By collapsing sidebar categories, we’ve aimed to create a cleaner and more intuitive navigation experience for you. This should make it easier to find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that you have the latest insights at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

These changes matter because they reflect our ongoing dedication to improving how you interact with our framework. We believe that a well-structured and accessible documentation site empowers you to adopt Fabric more effectively. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts truly make a difference!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July that truly reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This new content is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, ensuring that you can easily navigate through the information you need to make informed decisions. You can check out the details in our [initial documentation for Fabric Adoption Framework](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this new content, we also made some important adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation on the Fabric Framework. This streamlining helps to reduce confusion and allows you to focus on the most relevant and up-to-date information available. I believe this clarity will make your journey through our resources much smoother and more enjoyable. You can read more about these changes [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their invaluable input and support in making these updates possible. Your feedback is instrumental in shaping our documentation, and I can’t wait to see how these changes will positively impact your experience. Together, we're building a more cohesive and supportive framework for everyone involved.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without navigating through multiple sections that may not be as relevant anymore. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe that simplifying our documentation will enhance your experience as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework. By focusing on the most pertinent information, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. This change reflects our commitment to listening to your feedback and continuously improving how we present our resources. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision; your insights are invaluable to us!

As we move forward, I’m optimistic that these adjustments will make it easier for you to engage with our content and find what you’re looking for more quickly. We’re always here to support you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I can’t wait to hear how these changes impact your experience.
