# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the meaningful changes we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced a new License section in our documentation, which not only clarifies the terms under which our resources can be used but also adds a dedicated link in the navigation menu for easier access (Read more ›). This change reflects our commitment to transparency and ensures you have all the information you need at your fingertips.

Additionally, we've made strides in organizing our content more effectively. By collapsing the sidebar categories, we’ve improved clarity and navigation, making it simpler for you to find what you’re looking for (Read more ›). We also synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring that the latest insights and guidance are readily available to support your adoption journey (Read more ›). These updates are all about making your experience smoother and more intuitive, and I truly believe they will have a positive impact on how you engage with our resources.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable, and it drives us to keep improving. Together, we’re creating a space that is not only informative but also welcoming and user-friendly. I can’t wait to see how you utilize these enhancements!

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation to better serve you. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which is designed to provide clarity and guidance on how to effectively implement our practices. This new content is structured to be approachable and informative, ensuring that you have the resources you need right at your fingertips (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also removed some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, allowing us to streamline our resources and focus on what truly matters for your journey with the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This cleanup not only declutters our site but also enhances your experience by making it easier to navigate through the most pertinent information.

I’m particularly grateful to our contributors and community for their efforts in shaping this content. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable, and I believe these updates will have a positive impact as you explore the framework further. Together, we’re building a more supportive and user-friendly environment for everyone involved (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month has brought some significant changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to streamline our content by removing the "What's New" documentation section. This change was made to enhance your experience by ensuring that the information you find is more cohesive and easier to navigate. By consolidating updates and removing redundancy, we hope to create a more fluid reading experience for you. If you’re curious about the specifics, you can check out the details of this decision [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I truly believe this shift will help you focus on the most relevant and impactful content without being distracted by separate update sections. It’s all about making your journey with us smoother and more enjoyable. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed their thoughts and feedback on this change. Your input is invaluable and helps us grow together.

As we continue to evolve, I’m excited about the positive impact these adjustments will have on your experience with our documentation.
