# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that we’ve rolled out on the Fabric Adoption Framework website. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a new License link in the navigation menu. This enhancement not only clarifies how our content can be used but also makes it easier for you to find this important information right where you need it (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

We've also worked hard to improve the overall navigation experience by collapsing sidebar categories for better clarity. This change aims to make it easier for you to find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed by choices (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded their visibility within the documentation. This means you’ll have a more comprehensive understanding of the strategies available for Fabric adoption, all in one place (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback, which truly helps us create a better experience for everyone. We hope these updates will make your journey through our documentation smoother and more enjoyable. As always, we’re committed to continuously improving, and we look forward to hearing your thoughts!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some meaningful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by establishing initial content for the adoption framework, which is a crucial step in guiding you through the process of integrating our practices into your own environments. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

We’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup not only helps in decluttering the navigation but also allows you to focus on the most pertinent information as you embark on your adoption journey. I truly appreciate the contributions from our community that have made these updates possible, and I hope you find the new structure more intuitive and user-friendly (Read more ›).

As we continue to refine our documentation, I’m optimistic that these changes will foster a clearer understanding of the Fabric Adoption Framework and support you in your endeavors. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us, and I look forward to hearing your feedback as you explore the new content!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month has brought some significant changes to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation, and I’m excited to share them with you. We've made the decision to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this might feel like a big shift, it’s all part of our effort to streamline the content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30).

Why does this matter? By removing the "What's New" section, we aim to enhance the overall user experience. This change allows us to focus on providing you with the most relevant and updated content without the clutter of a separate section. We believe this will help you navigate our documentation more intuitively, making your journey smoother and more enjoyable. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable in shaping our documentation, and I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your experience with the framework. If you're curious about the details of this transition, feel free to explore more [here](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30).
