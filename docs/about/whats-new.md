Hello, dear readers! August has been a bustling month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. We’ve made significant strides in refining our content and structure to better serve you.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that reflect our commitment to making the Fabric Adoption Framework more accessible and user-friendly. This month, we’ve laid down the initial content for the adoption framework, which is a significant step forward in providing you with the guidance you need to navigate this journey. You can read all about it in the detailed changes we made on July 20th (Read more ›) and find the initial documentation that sets the stage for what’s to come (Read more ›).

We also took the time to streamline our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant to our current direction. This helps to declutter the space and ensures that you can easily find the information that truly matters to you. By focusing on the essentials, we hope to enhance your experience and make it simpler to engage with the framework. You can see more about these removals in our updates (Read more ›).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your input and dedication are what make this community so special. As we continue to build and refine our resources, I’m optimistic that these updates will empower you on your adoption journey. Together, we’re creating a more cohesive and supportive environment for all.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We decided to remove the "What's New" section from our site. While this might feel like a big shift, our goal is to streamline the information you receive and make it easier for you to find what truly matters. By consolidating updates directly into relevant sections, we hope to create a more cohesive and engaging reading experience. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision stems from our commitment to ensuring that you have access to the most pertinent information without unnecessary distractions. We believe that by integrating updates into the main content, you will have a clearer understanding of how our framework evolves and adapts to your needs. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback, which guided us in making this decision.

As we move forward, I am excited to see how these changes will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. I truly hope you find the new structure more intuitive and user-friendly. Your experience is at the heart of everything we do, and I can't wait to hear your thoughts!
