# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content and improving navigation. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now has its own dedicated link in the navigation menu. This makes it easier for you to find essential information about usage rights and responsibilities (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our resources, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for clarity. This change is designed to help you navigate our documentation more intuitively, allowing you to focus on what matters most to you. Additionally, we've updated some of our strategy methodology documents and expanded their visibility, ensuring that you have access to the latest insights and practices for effective Fabric adoption (Read more ›).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by introducing initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it more accessible and user-friendly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our community’s needs. This cleanup not only helps in decluttering our resources but also ensures that you can easily find the most relevant information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). By focusing on what truly matters, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you as you explore the framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on the essentials, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience for everyone. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I want to emphasize how important this change is for you, our community. By eliminating the "What's New" section, we aim to reduce clutter and make room for more relevant content that directly supports your journey with the framework. This means you can expect a more focused and engaging experience as you navigate through our resources. I truly appreciate the feedback and contributions from all of you that have guided us in this direction. 

As we continue to evolve, I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your use of the framework. Your insights are invaluable, and I encourage you to keep sharing them with us. Together, we can create an even better resource for everyone involved. Thank you for being a part of this journey!
