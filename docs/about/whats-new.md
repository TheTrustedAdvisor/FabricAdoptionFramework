This decision was made with your experience in mind, aiming to enhance navigation and help you find what you're looking for more efficiently (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing a clean and user-friendly experience. By eliminating redundancy, we hope to create a more cohesive flow of information that allows you to engage with our content without unnecessary distractions. We are excited about the potential impact this will have on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we strive to make your learning and implementation process as smooth as possible (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
