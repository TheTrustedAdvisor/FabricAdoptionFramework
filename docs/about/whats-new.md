## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm thrilled to share some of the exciting changes we've implemented. We’ve added initial content that lays the foundation for our adoption framework, giving you a clearer understanding of its purpose and benefits. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier for you to navigate and implement our framework effectively. You can read more about this initial documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps us focus on the most valuable and up-to-date resources for you. By refining our content, we hope to enhance your experience and make it simpler for you to find what you need. You can check out the details of this cleanup [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).
