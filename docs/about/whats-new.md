# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the updates we’ve made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which now provides clarity on usage rights and responsibilities. We’ve also made it easier for you to find this information by adding a License link directly to the navigation menu (Read more ›). These adjustments are designed to ensure that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips.

In our ongoing effort to improve the overall structure of our documentation, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for better clarity. This change aims to streamline your navigation, making it simpler to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents, which means you’ll have access to the latest insights and strategies for Fabric adoption, all in one place (Read more ›). 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input helps us create a more user-friendly experience, and we’re excited about the positive impact these changes will have on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a big shift, it allows us to streamline our content and focus more on delivering the information you truly need. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision was made with your feedback in mind. We understand that navigating through documentation can sometimes feel overwhelming, and we want to make it as user-friendly as possible. By eliminating redundant sections, we hope to create a more cohesive and engaging experience for you. Our goal is to ensure that you can easily find the information you’re looking for without any unnecessary distractions. 

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our community and contributors for your ongoing support and insights. Your input is invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve you. I’m excited about these changes and look forward to seeing how they impact your journey with us. Together, we can continue to build a more accessible and welcoming space for everyone involved.
