# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve refreshed our content significantly, including the addition of a new License section in the documentation, which is now easily accessible via the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also fosters transparency, making it easier for you to understand your rights and responsibilities as you engage with our resources (Read more ›).

In our ongoing effort to streamline your journey through our documentation, we’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for improved clarity. This means you can navigate more intuitively and find the information you need without feeling overwhelmed. Additionally, we’ve synchronized various strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy categories. These enhancements reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, organized, and relevant content that supports your adoption journey (Read more ›).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your input and dedication make a real difference in how we serve our community.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some wonderful updates that have taken shape. We’ve added initial content for our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of adopting our tools and practices effectively. This foundational content is not just a collection of guidelines; it’s a supportive resource aimed at helping you navigate your adoption journey with confidence (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this, we’ve introduced a comprehensive overview of the Fabric Adoption Framework. This overview serves as a roadmap, providing clarity on what to expect as you engage with our framework. It’s important to us that you feel equipped and informed, and this overview is a step in that direction (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback, which have been invaluable in shaping these updates.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some recent updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. This month, we made a significant decision to streamline our content by removing the “What's New” documentation section. While it may seem like a small change, it reflects our commitment to providing you with the most relevant and accessible information. You can read more about this decision [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By eliminating this section, we’re aiming to declutter the documentation and focus on delivering content that truly matters to you. We believe that this will make it easier for you to navigate and find the information you need without sifting through outdated updates. The goal is to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience, allowing you to engage with the material more effectively. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable, and it helps us continuously improve. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework!
