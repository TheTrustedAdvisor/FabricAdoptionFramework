## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some significant updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to making your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even better. This month, we made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. While it may seem like a big change, we believe it will streamline our content and help you find the information you need more easily. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment is important because it allows us to consolidate our updates and focus on delivering the most relevant and impactful content directly to you. By simplifying our structure, we hope to enhance your navigation experience and ensure that you can access the most critical information without unnecessary distractions. Our goal is to create a more cohesive and user-friendly environment for everyone involved in the framework.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable as we continue to evolve our documentation.
