# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in our documentation to ensure it's more user-friendly and accessible. One of the highlights is the addition of a License section, which now has its own dedicated link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our licensing terms but also makes it easier for you to find important information (Read more ›).

We've also worked hard to improve the structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we’ve made it simpler for you to navigate through the content. This means you can spend less time searching and more time focusing on what truly matters—your adoption journey. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date resources at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and community members who have helped us reach these milestones. Your input and support are invaluable as we strive to create a more cohesive and engaging experience for everyone. I hope you find these updates helpful, and I can't wait to see how they impact your journey with us!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made the significant decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While this might feel like a big change, it’s all part of our ongoing effort to streamline the content and make it easier for you to find the information you need. If you’re curious about the specifics, you can read more about it [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that changes like this can sometimes feel unsettling, but I truly believe this will allow us to focus more on delivering valuable content that speaks directly to your needs. By simplifying our structure, we hope to create a more intuitive navigation experience, making it easier for you to access the resources that matter most. Your feedback has been invaluable in guiding these adjustments, and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed their thoughts and insights.

As we continue to refine our documentation, I’m optimistic that these changes will lead to a more engaging and user-friendly experience for all of you. I’m excited to see how this evolves and hope you’ll find it easier to navigate and utilize the resources we provide. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us!
