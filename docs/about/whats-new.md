# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation to make it even more accessible and user-friendly. One of the standout changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, along with a convenient link in the navigation menu. This clarity around licensing is crucial for anyone looking to understand their rights and responsibilities, and I hope it makes your journey smoother (Read more ›).

We’ve also taken the time to synchronize our published strategy methodology documents and expand the visibility of our strategy category within the docs. This means you’ll have easier access to the resources you need, allowing you to navigate through our strategies with greater ease and confidence (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, ensuring that you can find what you’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed. These changes reflect our commitment to continuously improving your experience and supporting your adoption journey.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your insights and dedication truly make a difference. I’m looking forward to seeing how these enhancements impact your exploration of the framework!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enrich your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in shaping our documentation to better serve you. We’ve introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This means you now have access to clear and structured guidance as you navigate your adoption journey (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps ensure that you’re not overwhelmed by outdated information and can focus on the resources that truly matter. By refining our structure, we aim to create a more intuitive experience for you as you explore the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This June, we made some notable changes to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to streamline our content by removing the “What’s New” section from our documentation. This decision was made to enhance the overall experience and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without any clutter. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you. This means less time searching for updates and more time focusing on what truly matters—implementing the framework effectively. I believe that this change will help foster a clearer understanding of our content and make it easier for you to access the information you need. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision and for your ongoing support in making our documentation better for all.

We’re hopeful that these adjustments will lead to a smoother journey as you explore the Fabric Adoption Framework. Your feedback is invaluable, and I encourage you to share your thoughts as we continue to evolve our documentation. Together, we can create a resource that truly serves your needs.
