# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the changes we've made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant updates is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which you can now easily find in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage guidelines but also helps foster a transparent and collaborative environment for everyone involved in our community (Read more ›). 

We've also worked hard to streamline the way you navigate our content. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we aim to make it easier for you to find what you're looking for without feeling overwhelmed. This small but impactful change is all about ensuring that your journey through our documentation is as smooth as possible (Read more ›). 

Additionally, we've synchronized our strategy methodology documents and expanded their visibility in the docs. This means you can now access the latest insights and strategies to support your Fabric adoption efforts more readily than ever before (Read more ›). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates; your input truly makes a difference. Together, we’re building a resource that I hope will empower you on your journey. (503 commits)

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this may seem like a small adjustment, it’s a step towards streamlining our content and making it easier for you to navigate the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why did we make this change? Our goal is to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. By eliminating redundancy and focusing on the most relevant content, we’re hoping to help you find what you need more quickly and efficiently. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improving the documentation based on your feedback and needs. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to this decision and shared their insights. Your voices truly matter!

As we move forward, I expect this update will lead to a more engaging experience for all of you. With less clutter in the documentation, I hope you’ll find it easier to dive into the resources that support your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Let’s keep this momentum going together!
