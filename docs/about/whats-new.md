## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for our adoption framework, which is designed to guide you through the process of integrating and utilizing our offerings effectively. It’s a significant step forward, as we’ve established a solid foundation for you to explore and understand the framework in depth (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to this new content, we also made some important adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files. This helps to streamline your navigation and ensures that you’re only seeing the most relevant and up-to-date information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). These changes matter because they not only declutter our resources but also enhance your journey as you learn and adopt the framework. 

As we continue to grow and evolve, I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your input and support are invaluable, and I’m eager to see how these changes will impact our community moving forward. Together, we’re building something special!

## June 2025

Hello dear readers! This month, we made a significant change that I want to share with you. We decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section from our website. This was not a decision made lightly; it reflects our commitment to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find what truly matters. By consolidating information, we hope to enhance your experience and ensure that you can navigate our resources with greater ease (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, we believe that clarity and simplicity are key to effective communication. By eliminating redundant sections, we’re focusing on delivering the most relevant content directly to you. This change is all about making your journey through our documentation more enjoyable and efficient, allowing you to spend less time searching and more time engaging with the material that supports your work (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their invaluable feedback, which guided us in making this decision.
