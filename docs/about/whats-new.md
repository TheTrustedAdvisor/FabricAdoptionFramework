# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in refining our documentation. We’ve synchronized new content to ensure everything is up-to-date and relevant, which is crucial for you to navigate the framework effectively (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve added a License section and a corresponding link in the navigation menu, making it easier for you to access important legal information (Read more ›).

We also took a thoughtful approach to our documentation structure. By collapsing sidebar categories, we aimed to create a clearer and more streamlined navigation experience. This should help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). I genuinely appreciate the contributions from our community that made these enhancements possible. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we strive to create a welcoming and informative space for everyone interested in Fabric adoption.

As we continue to grow and evolve, I hope these changes make your journey smoother and more enjoyable. Thank you for being a part of this community! (Read more ›) [531 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-08-01&until=2025-08-31)

In addition to adding this valuable information, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This helps streamline our resources and ensures that you have access to the most pertinent information without any clutter (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the “What’s New” section from our documentation. This change was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on the most relevant updates and insights, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience for everyone (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I want to emphasize that this decision was not taken lightly. We believe that by simplifying our structure, we can better serve your needs and help you navigate our resources with greater ease. This change is part of our ongoing commitment to improving the reader-facing user experience, and I’m excited about the positive impact it will have on how you engage with our content.
