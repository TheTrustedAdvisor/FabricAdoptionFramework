## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience as you navigate through the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made with careful consideration, as we aim to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. If you're curious about the specifics, you can check out the details here: (Read more ›) /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md.

Why does this matter? By eliminating the "What's New" section, we hope to declutter the navigation and focus on providing you with the most relevant and up-to-date information without any distractions. This change reflects our commitment to improving your user experience and ensuring that you can easily access the insights you need to effectively adopt our framework.

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable, and it helps us create a more cohesive and user-friendly documentation experience. I’m excited about these changes and look forward to seeing how they positively impact your journey with us!
