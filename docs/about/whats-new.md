In addition to the content updates, we’ve made some structural improvements to enhance your experience. You’ll notice that the sidebar categories have been collapsed for better clarity, making it simpler to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed.

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, as we've rolled out some foundational content that I believe will truly enhance your experience.

In addition to the new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter the site and ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated materials. I hope this makes your journey with us smoother and more intuitive (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello everyone! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation. While this section has served us well, we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through updates that may no longer be relevant (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with a more intuitive and user-friendly experience. By simplifying our navigation and focusing on the core content that supports your journey, we hope to make your exploration of the framework more enjoyable and efficient. I truly appreciate the feedback from our community that led us to this decision, and I want to thank everyone who contributed to the discussions around this change.

Looking ahead, we expect that this streamlined approach will help you find the resources you need faster and with less clutter. Our goal is to ensure that your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework is as seamless as possible, and I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your journey. Thank you for being a part of our community!
