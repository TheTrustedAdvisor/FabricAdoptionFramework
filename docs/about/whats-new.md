## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we took a significant step forward by establishing the initial content for the adoption framework, which aims to guide you through the process of integrating and utilizing this framework effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). It’s not just about the content; it’s about creating a resource that feels welcoming and supportive as you navigate your journey.

We also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant, ensuring that the information you find is clear and focused on what truly matters (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This streamlining is essential for making your experience smoother and more intuitive, allowing you to find the guidance you need without unnecessary distractions. I genuinely appreciate the contributions from our community that have helped us refine our materials and make them more user-friendly.

As we continue to develop this framework, I expect that these changes will have a positive impact on how you engage with our documentation. The clearer structure and focused content should empower you to adopt the framework with confidence. Thank you for being a part of this journey with us, and for your ongoing support as we strive to make this resource the best it can be.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience navigating the Fabric Adoption Framework. Most notably, we've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This change reflects our commitment to streamlining the information we provide, ensuring that you can find what you need without any unnecessary clutter. You can read more about this decision [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our structure, we aim to create a more intuitive experience for you, our valued readers. We want to make it easier for you to access the most relevant information without sifting through outdated or repetitive content. This shift is all about enhancing clarity and usability, and I genuinely believe it will make a positive impact on your journey with us.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to our contributors and the community for their feedback and support in this process. Your insights are invaluable, and together, we're making the Fabric Adoption Framework a more user-friendly resource. I’m excited to see how these changes will help you engage more deeply with our content!
