Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

In addition to this, we’ve streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our purpose. This cleanup not only declutters the site but also ensures that you’re only seeing the most relevant and useful information as you explore the framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).
