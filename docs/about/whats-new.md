## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" section from our documentation. After careful consideration, we decided that this space could be better utilized for more relevant content that directly supports your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This decision matters because it reflects our commitment to providing you with the most useful and streamlined information. By removing the "What's New" section, we aim to reduce clutter and focus on delivering content that truly empowers you in your adoption efforts. We believe this will make navigation easier and help you find what you need more quickly.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed their thoughts and feedback on this change. Your insights are invaluable, and they guide us in making improvements that matter. I’m excited about the positive impact these adjustments will have on your experience as you explore our resources. Together, we're creating a more user-friendly environment! (Read more ›) [19 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30)
