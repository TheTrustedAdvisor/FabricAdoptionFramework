## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content and improving navigation. Notably, we collapsed the sidebar categories for better clarity, making it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md). 

We also added a License section to our documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu. This addition is crucial as it provides transparency and clarity regarding the usage of our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md) (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-5c7af7d42f049ba974347b811dbea587eedf7a00.md). These changes not only streamline your journey through our documentation but also ensure that you have all the necessary information at your fingertips.

Lastly, I’m thrilled to announce that we’ve updated our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of our strategy category. These enhancements are designed to provide you with a more comprehensive understanding of our framework and its applications (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md) (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c74.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we rolled out the initial content for our adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for a more structured approach to integrating Fabric into your projects. You can dive into the details of this new content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). 

We also made some important adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our community’s needs. This streamlining helps ensure that you have access to the most relevant and up-to-date information without any clutter. You can find more about this clean-up [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). 

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to continuously improving the resources we provide for you. By focusing on clarity and relevance, we hope to foster a smoother adoption process and empower you to make the most of the Fabric framework. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts are truly appreciated!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the “What’s New” documentation section from our site. This decision was made to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By doing this, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience as you navigate through our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can sometimes feel a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will enhance your journey with us. With the removal of the “What’s New” section, we’re focusing on ensuring that all updates and important information are integrated seamlessly throughout the documentation. This means less clutter and more clarity, allowing you to dive right into the content you need without sifting through separate sections (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who has contributed to this effort. Your feedback and support are invaluable, and I’m excited to see how these changes will positively impact your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re making our documentation a better place for all of us (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md). (19 commits)
