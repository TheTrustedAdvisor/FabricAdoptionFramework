## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from August 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we’ve made significant strides in organizing our content and improving navigation. For instance, we collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, making it easier for you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category, allowing you to access important information more intuitively (Read more ›).

We also introduced a new License section in our documentation, along with a direct link in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our usage policies but also reflects our commitment to transparency and accessibility (Read more ›). I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts truly make a difference in how our community interacts with the framework.

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I can’t wait to share the updates with you! We’ve made significant strides by adding initial content for the adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for understanding how to effectively integrate our practices. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and implement our framework in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

In addition to this, we’ve also established a comprehensive overview of the Fabric Adoption Framework. This overview serves as a friendly starting point, helping you grasp the key concepts and benefits of adoption. I believe this will enhance your experience and provide clarity as you explore the framework further (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. One of the most notable updates is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the information you need more easily. Instead of a separate section, we are focusing on integrating updates directly into relevant documentation, making it more cohesive and user-friendly (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I understand that change can be a bit unsettling, but I genuinely believe this will lead to a more intuitive navigation experience for you. By embedding updates within the context of the content, we hope to provide a clearer picture of how our framework evolves and how it can better serve your needs. This change reflects our commitment to continuously improve and adapt based on your feedback. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who has contributed to this process; your insights are invaluable (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, I am excited to see how these adjustments will help you engage more deeply with our documentation. I truly believe that these updates will foster a more connected and informed community. Let's keep the conversation going, and as always, I appreciate your support and involvement in making our documentation better for everyone (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-7c6550e937678bffe3597b09ea2138ab7df9c60d.md).
