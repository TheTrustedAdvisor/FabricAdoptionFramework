# What's new

## August 2025

Hello dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates we've made to the Fabric Adoption Framework this August. We’ve been busy enhancing our documentation to make it clearer and more user-friendly. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which is now easily accessible through the navigation menu. This is an important step in ensuring that everyone understands the terms under which our content can be used (Read more ›). 

Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded the visibility of the strategy category within our docs. This means you’ll find it easier to navigate and locate the resources you need to support your adoption journey (Read more ›). We believe these changes will help you feel more empowered and informed as you engage with our materials. 

Lastly, we’ve made some adjustments to the sidebar categories for better clarity, and I’m thrilled to announce that our logo has received a fresh new look! Thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts truly make a difference in our community. I hope you enjoy exploring these changes as much as we enjoyed implementing them!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and user-friendly documentation experience by introducing the initial content for the adoption framework. This foundational material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement. You can check out the details about this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant. This streamlining is essential as it helps us focus on providing you with the most accurate and useful information. By decluttering our resources, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience for you, allowing you to find what you need without any distractions. You can read more about the removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to these updates. Your efforts are invaluable in shaping a resource that truly serves our community. I’m looking forward to seeing how these changes positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework! Together, we’re building something great.

## June 2025

Hello everyone! I’m excited to share some updates from June that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small adjustment, we believe this will streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. We understand that your time is valuable, and we want to ensure that you can quickly access the resources you need without wading through unnecessary sections. This change is a direct response to your feedback, and I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone in our community who contributed their thoughts and insights to help us improve (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).
