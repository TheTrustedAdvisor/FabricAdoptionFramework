Hello, dear readers! August has been a busy month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful updates we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve synchronized a wealth of new content, including the addition of our License section and a link to it in the navigation menu.

We’ve also made some structural improvements by collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, which I believe will help you find what you need more quickly and intuitively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some of the changes we’ve made to enhance your experience. We’ve introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, providing a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices. This new content is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to navigate and apply the framework in your own projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md).

In addition to adding new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps ensure that you find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some recent updates that we've made to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation this June. One significant change is the removal of the "What's New" documentation section. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without any clutter. By focusing on more impactful sections, we hope to enhance your experience as you navigate through our resources. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? Well, we believe that a more concise documentation structure will help you quickly locate the information you need, making your journey with us smoother and more enjoyable. We want you to spend less time searching and more time implementing the insights you gain from our materials. The feedback from our community has been invaluable in shaping these updates, and I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed their thoughts and suggestions.

As we move forward, we expect these changes to foster a more engaging and user-friendly environment for all our readers. Your experience is at the forefront of our minds, and we’re committed to making our documentation as helpful as possible. I look forward to hearing how these updates resonate with you!
