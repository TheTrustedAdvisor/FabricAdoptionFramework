## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we made some significant changes to our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation entirely. This decision was made to streamline our content and ensure that you can find the most relevant information without the clutter of repeated updates. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why does this matter? By simplifying our structure, we aim to make it easier for you to navigate and access the information that truly matters to you. We want to focus on providing clear and concise content that helps you in your journey with the framework. I genuinely believe that this will lead to a more enjoyable and productive experience. A heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community for your feedback and support as we continue to evolve our documentation.

As we move forward, I expect these changes to foster a more intuitive understanding of our resources, allowing you to dive deeper into the content that interests you most. Your engagement and insights are invaluable to us, and I’m excited to see how these adjustments will benefit you. Please feel free to share your thoughts with us!
