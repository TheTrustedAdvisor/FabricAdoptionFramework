# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the wonderful updates we’ve made to enhance your experience. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a License section to our documentation, which not only clarifies usage rights but also strengthens our commitment to transparency (Read more ›). We’ve also revamped our navigation menu to include a direct link to this new License section, making it easier for you to find essential information at a glance (Read more ›). 

In our efforts to improve clarity and accessibility, we’ve collapsed sidebar categories, which should help you navigate through the content with greater ease (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized and updated our published strategy methodology documents, ensuring you have the most relevant and up-to-date resources at your fingertips (Read more ›). I truly believe these enhancements will make your journey through the framework more intuitive and enjoyable.

A heartfelt thank you to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable, and it inspires us to keep improving. I can’t wait for you to explore these changes and see how they can benefit your Fabric adoption journey.

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for a more structured and user-friendly documentation experience. We introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which provides a clearer understanding of its purpose and how you can effectively engage with it (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This foundational content is designed to guide you as you navigate the framework, ensuring you have the resources you need at your fingertips.

In addition to adding new content, we also made the decision to remove some initial documentation files that were no longer relevant to our evolving framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This helps streamline your experience and keeps our documentation focused on what truly matters. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these changes. Your input is invaluable, and it truly makes a difference in creating a supportive community around our framework.

As we continue to refine our documentation, I am hopeful that these updates will make it easier for you to adopt and integrate the Fabric framework into your projects. Our goal is to foster a welcoming environment where you can find the information you need without any hassle. I can't wait to see how these changes positively impact your journey with us!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While this might seem like a big shift, it allows us to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I believe this adjustment matters because it reflects our commitment to clarity and ease of navigation. By eliminating redundant sections, we aim to make it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through outdated updates. We hope that this will lead to a more intuitive experience as you explore our documentation.
