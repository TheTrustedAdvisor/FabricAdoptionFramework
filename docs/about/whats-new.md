# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some recent updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I believe will enhance your experience as you navigate our resources. In August, we made significant strides in refining our content and structure. We’ve added new documentation that lays the groundwork for our project, ensuring that you have a solid understanding of our goals and methodologies (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized various strategy documents to provide you with the most current insights on Fabric adoption (Read more ›). 

One of the most notable changes is the addition of a License section, which not only clarifies the usage rights but also includes a convenient link in our navigation menu (Read more ›). This is important because it helps you easily access the information you need, fostering a transparent and user-friendly environment. We’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, making it simpler for you to find what you’re looking for without feeling overwhelmed (Read more ›). 

These updates reflect our commitment to improving your experience and ensuring that our documentation is both accessible and informative. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community for your contributions and feedback, which help us grow and evolve. I hope you find these changes beneficial as you explore our resources!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that clearly outlines its purpose and structure. This foundational material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand how to integrate our framework into your projects. You can check out the details of this initial content [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to introducing new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter our resources and ensures that you can focus on the most pertinent information. By refining our documentation structure, we aim to make your journey through the framework more intuitive and enjoyable. If you're curious about the changes we've made, you can read more about them [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their continuous support and feedback. Your insights have been invaluable in shaping our documentation, and I’m confident that these updates will have a positive impact on how you engage with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Together, we’re building a resource that truly meets your needs. As always, I’m here to support you on this journey, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts on these changes!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, I want to share some significant updates that have taken place on our Fabric Adoption Framework website. We've made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it may seem like a small change, this shift is aimed at streamlining our content and making it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. By focusing on more relevant sections, we hope to enhance your experience and make navigation a breeze. For more details on this change, you can check out the specifics here: [Read more ›](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This adjustment is important because it reflects our commitment to providing you with the most relevant and useful content. We understand that your time is valuable, and we want to ensure that every visit to our site feels purposeful and engaging. By refining our documentation structure, we expect to see a more focused approach to how you access and utilize our resources. It’s all about making your journey smoother and more enjoyable!

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the contributors and the community for their feedback and support in making these changes possible.
