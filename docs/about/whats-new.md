# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some meaningful updates we’ve made to the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation this August. We've been busy enhancing the content and structure to make your experience smoother and more intuitive. One of the biggest changes is the addition of a License section, which now has its own dedicated link in the navigation menu. This should make it much easier for you to find important licensing information (Read more ›).

We’ve also taken steps to improve the visibility of our strategy category within the documentation. By expanding this section, we hope to provide you with clearer access to the strategies that can guide your Fabric adoption journey. Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies and methodology documents to ensure that you have the most current and relevant information at your fingertips (Read more ›). 

Lastly, we've made some adjustments to our sidebar categories, collapsing them for better clarity. This should help reduce clutter and make navigation a breeze. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates; your efforts truly make a difference in enhancing our community's experience (Read more ›). 

As we continue to grow and evolve, I hope these changes will make your journey with us even more enriching. Happy exploring! (531 commits)

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides by introducing the initial content for our adoption framework, which lays the groundwork for understanding and utilizing the framework effectively (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This is a big step forward in making our resources more accessible and user-friendly.

We also took the opportunity to streamline our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This cleanup not only simplifies navigation but also helps to ensure that you have the most pertinent information at your fingertips. I truly believe that these changes will create a more cohesive and enjoyable reading experience for everyone.

A heartfelt thank you goes out to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and input.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made a significant change to our documentation structure that I believe will enhance your experience. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section. This was not an easy decision, but we felt it was time to streamline our content and make it more intuitive for you. By consolidating updates into our main documentation, we aim to create a more cohesive reading experience that keeps you engaged with the most relevant information. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

I genuinely believe this shift will help you navigate our resources more effectively, allowing you to focus on the content that matters most to you without the distraction of separate sections. Thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision; your feedback is invaluable in shaping our community’s resources. I’m excited to see how this change positively impacts your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. 

As always, we’re committed to improving your experience, and I can’t wait to hear your thoughts on this new structure. Let’s continue to grow and learn together! (Read more ›) [19 commits](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30)
