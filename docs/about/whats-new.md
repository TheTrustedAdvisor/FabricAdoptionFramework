# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most significant changes is the addition of a new License section, which now offers clarity on how you can use our resources. You can find this in our navigation menu, making it easier than ever to access important information (Read more ›). This change reflects our commitment to transparency and ensures that you have the guidance you need to navigate your adoption journey confidently.

We also made strides in improving the overall structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories for clarity, we’ve streamlined navigation, allowing you to find what you need without feeling overwhelmed. This thoughtful adjustment is designed to create a more user-friendly experience, so you can focus on the content that matters most to you (Read more ›). Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, which means you’ll have the latest methodologies at your fingertips, empowering you to make informed decisions (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights help us continuously improve and ensure that our documentation serves you well. Together, we’re building a resource that truly meets your needs. As we move forward, I hope these updates make your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more enriching. Thank you for being a part of our community!

July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some significant updates with you! We’ve made great strides in enhancing our documentation, particularly with the introduction of the initial content for the adoption framework.

It’s all about making your experience smoother and more intuitive as you engage with our framework.

Additionally, we’ve streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps us focus on the most useful and up-to-date resources for you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this effort; your insights and feedback are invaluable in shaping our documentation.

As we continue to refine and expand our resources, I’m hopeful that these updates will empower you on your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. Your engagement and support mean the world to us, and I can’t wait to see how these changes positively impact your experience (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change to our documentation structure by removing the "What's New" section entirely. While it may seem like a big shift, this decision stems from our commitment to streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the most relevant information. By consolidating updates into our main content, we believe you’ll have a clearer path to the insights and resources you need. If you're curious about the details of this change, you can read more about it [here](https://www.fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our ongoing effort to enhance the usability of our documentation. We want you to spend less time searching for updates and more time engaging with the content that truly matters to you. By integrating updates directly into the relevant sections, we hope to create a more cohesive and user-friendly experience. Thank you to everyone in our community for your feedback and support, which made this transition possible!

As we move forward, we anticipate that this new approach will foster a more intuitive navigation experience for all our readers. Your journey through our documentation should feel seamless, and we’re excited to see how this change will help you connect with the information you seek.
