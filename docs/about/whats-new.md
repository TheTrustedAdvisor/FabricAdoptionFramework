# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has been a vibrant month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some meaningful updates that enhance your experience with our documentation. One of the most notable changes is the addition of a dedicated License section, which not only clarifies the terms of use but also strengthens our commitment to transparency. You can check it out in our navigation menu, making it easier than ever to find essential information (Read more ›).

Additionally, we’ve made strides in organizing our content for better clarity. The sidebar categories have been collapsed, allowing for a more streamlined navigation experience. This should help you find what you need without feeling overwhelmed by options. We’ve also updated the visibility of our strategy category, ensuring that the most relevant documents are front and center (Read more ›). These changes are all about making your journey through our resources smoother and more intuitive.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable as we continue to evolve and improve.
