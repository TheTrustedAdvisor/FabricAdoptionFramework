## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve laid the groundwork for our adoption framework by adding initial content that outlines its purpose and structure. This new material is designed to guide you through the adoption process, making it easier to understand and implement. You can explore the details of this initial documentation [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md).

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some of the initial files that were no longer relevant. This helps to declutter the site and ensures that you can find the most pertinent information without sifting through outdated materials. You can read more about these removals [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md) and [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-07-20-f863dac1f384f0aa2884e31629a6a4a290de7ba5.md).

These changes matter because they reflect our commitment to providing you with clear, concise, and relevant information. By establishing an organized framework, we hope to make your journey smoother and more intuitive. A heartfelt thank you to all the contributors who helped bring this vision to life. Your efforts truly make a difference! I’m looking forward to seeing how these updates will impact your experience.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some updates from June 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to enhancing your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section. While it might seem like a small adjustment, this decision was made with careful consideration of how we can streamline information and make it easier for you to find what truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

By simplifying our documentation structure, we aim to create a more intuitive navigation experience. We believe this will help you focus on the most relevant content without the distraction of redundant sections. It’s all about making your journey through our resources smoother and more enjoyable. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this decision; your feedback is invaluable in guiding our path forward.

As we continue to evolve, we anticipate that these changes will foster a more engaging and user-friendly environment for all of you. We’re excited to see how this will enhance your interactions with our documentation. Thank you for being a part of our community and for your ongoing support!
