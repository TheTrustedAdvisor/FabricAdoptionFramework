Additionally, we’ve synchronized our published strategies for Fabric adoption, ensuring that you have the most up-to-date methodologies at your fingertips (Read more ›).

Hello, dear readers! July has been an exciting month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m thrilled to share some significant updates that I believe will enhance your experience. We’ve rolled out initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement our practices.

In addition to the new content, we've also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant. This cleanup helps to declutter the navigation and ensures that you can find the information you need without sifting through outdated resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).
