# What's new

## August 2025

Hello dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from August that enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We’ve made significant strides in improving our documentation, including the addition of a new License section, which you can now easily find in the navigation menu. This change not only clarifies our licensing terms but also ensures that you have quick access to important information that supports your journey with us (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md).

In our ongoing effort to make our resources more accessible, we've also synchronized our published strategy methodology documents and expanded their visibility in the documentation. This means you’ll have a clearer understanding of our strategies for Fabric adoption, making it easier for you to align your projects with our framework (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-f359f7af9238c768ef15da3bd9b4a18af45e0d78.md). Additionally, we’ve reorganized the sidebar categories for better clarity, helping you navigate our content with ease (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-07-428a3d2df5e70d8c5e77d1111e8edbf72439302d.md).

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that reflect our ongoing commitment to improving your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve taken significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation. We’ve added initial content that outlines the adoption framework, giving you a clearer understanding of its purpose and structure (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-539a4eb0953aed159d80b720e6c646c0252a5378.md). This is a big leap forward, and I truly believe it will help guide you as you navigate this journey.

In addition to the new content, we’ve also streamlined our documentation by removing some initial files that were no longer relevant (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). This decluttering allows us to focus on providing you with the most useful and up-to-date information. I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone in our community who contributed to these changes. Your feedback and support are invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve you.

As we move forward, I’m hopeful that these updates will enhance your understanding and engagement with the Fabric Adoption Framework. The clearer structure and focused content are designed to empower you as you adopt and implement the framework in your own projects. I’m excited to see how these changes will impact your experience! (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md) Together, we’re building something great.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some important updates from June 2025 that will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework documentation. This month, we made the decision to remove the "What's New" documentation section. While it served its purpose, we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and engaging information. You can read more about this change [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it allows us to consolidate our updates into a more cohesive narrative throughout the documentation. By eliminating the separate section, we aim to create a smoother navigation experience, making it easier for you to find the information you need without sifting through multiple areas. We believe this will help foster a more intuitive understanding of our framework and its evolution. For more details on the removal, check out this link [here](https://about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to our contributors and community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your insights are invaluable as we strive to improve our documentation. We hope these changes will positively impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework, making it even more accessible and user-friendly.
