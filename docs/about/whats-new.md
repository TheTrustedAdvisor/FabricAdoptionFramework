# What's new

## August 2025

August has been a busy month for us at the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the changes that have taken place! We’ve synchronized new content to ensure that our documentation remains up-to-date and relevant for you. This includes an initial project setup and some fresh strategy methodology documents that will help guide your adoption journey (Read more ›). We’ve also expanded the visibility of our strategy categories, making it easier for you to find the information you need quickly (Read more ›). 

In addition to these content updates, we’ve made some structural changes to enhance your experience. We collapsed the sidebar categories for clarity, allowing for a more streamlined navigation experience (Read more ›). Plus, we’ve added a new License section to our documentation, which you can now easily access from the navigation menu (Read more ›). These adjustments are all aimed at making your journey through our resources as smooth and intuitive as possible.

I want to extend a heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to these updates. Your feedback and support are invaluable to us, and we hope these enhancements make a meaningful difference in your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework.

Hello, dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve taken significant steps to establish the foundation of our documentation, introducing initial content that outlines the adoption framework in detail. You can check out the new overview and initial documentation, which aim to guide you through the framework's purpose and how to effectively implement it in your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

We also made the decision to remove some of the earlier documentation files that no longer align with our updated vision. This streamlining is essential as it helps us focus on providing you with the most relevant and useful information. By clearing out the old content, we can better serve your needs and ensure that you have access to the latest insights and guidance (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md).

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we’ve made some significant changes to our documentation structure that I’m excited to share with you. We’ve decided to remove the "What's New" section from our documentation entirely. This decision was made after careful consideration, as we felt it was time to streamline our content and focus on providing you with the most relevant and useful information without redundancy (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md). 

Why does this matter? By simplifying our documentation, we aim to enhance your experience and make it easier for you to find what you need without sifting through outdated or repetitive updates. We believe this change will help you navigate our resources more efficiently, allowing you to focus on what truly matters: adopting and implementing our framework effectively. 

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed to this decision and the changes that followed. Your feedback and insights are invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve our community. I’m looking forward to seeing how these adjustments positively impact your journey with us!
