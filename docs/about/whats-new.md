Hello, dear readers! August has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I'm excited to share some of the wonderful updates we've made to enhance your experience. We’ve synchronized new content and documentation from our development repository, ensuring that you have access to the most current information available (Read more ›). This means you can dive deeper into the strategies and methodologies that guide our framework, giving you the tools you need for effective adoption.

In addition to content updates, we’ve made some significant changes to our navigation. You’ll now find a new License section in the menu, making it easier to understand the terms under which our resources are shared (Read more ›). We’ve also collapsed sidebar categories for clarity, allowing you to navigate our documentation more smoothly (Read more ›). These changes are designed to make your journey through our resources more intuitive, so you can focus on what truly matters—adopting and benefiting from the Fabric framework.

By focusing on the core content, we aim to make navigation smoother and help you find what you need without unnecessary distractions (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).
