# What's new

## August 2025

August has brought some exciting updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework that I can't wait to share with you! We've added a new License section to our documentation, which not only clarifies the terms under which you can use our resources but also enhances transparency in our project. You can easily find this new section in the navigation menu, making it more accessible than ever (Read more ›). 

Additionally, we’ve made strides in improving the overall structure of our documentation. By collapsing sidebar categories, we've created a cleaner, more navigable experience for you, allowing you to find what you need with less clutter in your way (Read more ›). This change reflects our commitment to making your journey through our resources as smooth as possible. 

I want to take a moment to thank our contributors and the community for their ongoing support and feedback. Your input is invaluable in shaping our documentation to better serve you. Together, we are creating a more user-friendly experience, and I’m excited to see how these updates will help you on your adoption journey!

## July 2025

Hello, dear readers! I’m excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we’ve made significant strides in shaping the content and structure of our documentation. We introduced the initial content for the adoption framework, which lays a solid foundation for understanding how to effectively implement and benefit from our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-b6ea8bd71edcd6fcab2d774df9ea7b7b415bcbc2.md). This is a big step forward in making our framework more accessible and user-friendly.

In addition to adding new content, we also streamlined our documentation by removing outdated initial files that no longer serve our purpose. This cleanup helps to ensure that you find only the most relevant and helpful information as you navigate through our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). By refining our documentation, we aim to create a clearer path for you to follow as you adopt and implement our framework.

I want to take a moment to thank everyone in our community for your ongoing support and contributions. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable as we continue to evolve and improve our documentation. I look forward to seeing how these changes impact your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This June, we've made some significant updates to our Fabric Adoption Framework documentation that I’m excited to share with you. Most notably, we’ve decided to remove the “What’s New” documentation section. While this might feel like a big change, we believe it will streamline your experience and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://fabricadoptionframework.com/about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

Why did we make this decision? Our goal is to create a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. By simplifying our structure, we hope to help you focus on the content that supports your journey with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We believe that this will enhance your overall experience, making it easier to access the resources you need without unnecessary distractions.
