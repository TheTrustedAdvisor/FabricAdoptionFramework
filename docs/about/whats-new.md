# What's new

## August 2025

Hello, dear readers! August has brought some exciting updates to the Fabric Adoption Framework that I’m thrilled to share with you. We’ve made significant strides in enhancing our documentation, including the addition of a new License section and a corresponding link in the navigation menu. This change will help clarify the terms under which our content can be used, making it easier for you to engage with our resources (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-2fcc4ca958e093e082d40a93ab14ba804b31822d.md). 

Additionally, we’ve expanded the visibility of our strategy category in the documentation. This means you can now find our published strategies for Fabric adoption more easily, helping you navigate through the resources that matter most to you (Read more › /about/changes/2025-08-08-7d86c74.md). I hope these enhancements make your experience smoother and more enjoyable as you explore our framework.

## July 2025

Hello dear readers! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps in establishing the initial content for our adoption framework, which is now live and ready for you to explore. You can find a comprehensive overview that outlines the framework's purpose and benefits, making it easier for you to understand how to effectively adopt and integrate our solutions into your projects (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-21d18ea99b20ea417847b8f13538bf12ad8d7505.md).

In addition to the new content, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer serve our community’s needs. This cleanup allows us to present a more streamlined and focused resource for you, ensuring that you have access to the most relevant and helpful information (Read more › /about/changes/2025-07-20-3948fa7bc9ab671af8690e6527e831adebbec1dc.md). I truly appreciate the efforts of everyone involved in this process, as your contributions help us create a more user-friendly environment.

As we continue to refine our documentation, I am optimistic that these changes will not only clarify the adoption process but also empower you to make the most out of our framework. Your feedback and engagement are invaluable to us, and I encourage you to dive into the new content and share your thoughts. Together, we can foster a thriving community around the Fabric Adoption Framework.

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we made a significant change by removing the "What's New" documentation section from our site. While this might seem like a simple adjustment, it’s part of our ongoing effort to streamline your experience and make our documentation more intuitive. By consolidating information, we hope to reduce clutter and help you find what you need more quickly and easily (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-5a7d4f72ccbbd73c700b77c1b485216d1e29c0ea.md).

This change matters because it reflects our commitment to continuously improving how you interact with our content. We want to ensure that the information you seek is accessible and relevant, and by refining our structure, we aim to create a more cohesive experience. Your feedback has always been invaluable, and we appreciate the community's input that guided us in this direction (Read more › /about/changes/2025-06-03-3a35144aa92198574f983f6a3054dd2b5db3ab9c.md).

As we move forward, we expect this update to enhance your navigation and understanding of our documentation. We’re excited about the potential for a more seamless experience and look forward to hearing how these changes impact your journey with us.
