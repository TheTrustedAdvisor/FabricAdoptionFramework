Hello dear readers! August has been a transformative month for the Fabric Adoption Framework, and I’m excited to share some of the updates that have come your way.

This update is all about clarity and accessibility, allowing you to find what you need without unnecessary hassle. I truly believe these changes will empower you in your journey with us, and I’m grateful to our contributors for their hard work in making this happen.

## July 2025

Hello everyone! I'm excited to share some wonderful updates from July 2025 that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. This month, we took significant steps to establish a solid foundation for our documentation. We introduced initial content for the adoption framework, which lays out the principles and practices that will guide our community in effectively implementing Fabric. You can dive into this new content and see how it can support your journey (Read more ›).

In addition to the new content, we also made some necessary adjustments by removing outdated initial documentation files that no longer align with our framework’s vision. This streamlining not only helps clarify our direction but also ensures that you have access to the most relevant and helpful information. By refining our documentation structure, we aim to make it easier for you to find what you need and feel confident in your adoption process (Read more ›).

I want to take a moment to thank everyone who contributed to these changes. Your efforts are invaluable, and together, we are building a resource that truly serves our community. I hope these updates inspire you and make your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework even more rewarding. As always, I’m here for your feedback and suggestions as we continue to grow together!

## June 2025

Hello, dear readers! This month, we've made a significant change to the structure of our documentation that I believe will enhance your experience with the Fabric Adoption Framework. We've decided to remove the "What's New" documentation section entirely. This decision was made after careful consideration and feedback from many of you, our valued community members. The aim is to streamline our content and make it easier for you to find the information that truly matters. You can read more about this change [here](https://github.com/TheTrustedAdvisor/FabricAdoptionFramework/commits/main?since=2025-06-01&until=2025-06-30).

I know that changes like this can feel a bit unsettling at first, but I genuinely believe this will lead to a more cohesive and user-friendly navigation experience. By simplifying our documentation structure, we hope to help you focus on the core content that supports your journey with the framework. I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to everyone who contributed their thoughts and insights, as your input is invaluable in shaping our resources.

As we move forward, I expect this change will have a positive impact on how you engage with our documentation. With less clutter and more clarity, I hope you'll find it easier to dive into the material that inspires and guides you. Thank you for being part of this journey with us! (Read more ›)
